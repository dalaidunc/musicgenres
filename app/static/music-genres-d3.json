      "description": "Disco is a genre of dance music containing elements of funk, soul, pop, and salsa that was most popular in the mid to late 1970s, though it has had brief resurgences. Its initial audiences were club-goers from the gay, African American, Italian American, Latino, and psychedelic communities in Philadelphia and then later New York City during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Disco also was a reaction against both the domination of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music by the counterculture during this period. Women embraced disco as well, and the music eventually expanded to several other marginalized communities of the time. The disco sound has soaring vocals over a steady \"four-on-the-floor\" beat, an eighth note (quaver) or 16th note (semi-quaver) hi-hat pattern with an open hi-hat on the off-beat, and a prominent, syncopated electric bass line. In most disco tracks, strings, horns, electric pianos, and electric guitars create a lush background sound. Orchestral instruments such as the flute are often used for solo melodies, and lead guitar is less frequently used in disco than in rock. Many disco songs use electronic synthesizers. Well-known 1970s disco performers included Donna Summer, the Bee Gees, Boney M, KC and the Sunshine Band, The Trammps, Gloria Gaynor and Chic. While performers and singers garnered much public attention, record producers working behind the scenes played an important role. Many non-disco artists recorded disco songs at the height of disco's popularity, and films such as Saturday Night Fever and Thank God It's Friday contributed to disco's rise in mainstream popularity. Disco was the last mass popular music movement that was driven by the baby boom generation. Disco was a worldwide phenomenon, but its popularity drastically declined in the United States in 1979 and 1980, and disco was no longer popular in the U.S. by 1981. Disco Demolition Night, an anti-disco protest held in Chicago on 12 July 1979, is commonly thought of as a factor in disco's fast and drastic decline. By the late 1970s most major U.S. cities had thriving disco club scenes, with Studio 54 being a well-known example of a disco club. Popular dances included The Hustle, a sexually suggestive dance. Discotheque-goers often wore expensive and extravagant fashions. There was also a thriving drug subculture in the disco scene, particularly for drugs that would enhance the experience of dancing to the loud music and the flashing lights, such as cocaine. Disco was a key influence on the 1980s electronic dance music style called House. A disco revival was seen, first in 2005 with Madonna's album Confessions on a Dance Floor, and again in 2013, as disco-styled songs by artists like Daft Punk (with Nile Rodgers), Justin Timberlake, Breakbot, and Bruno Mars filled the pop charts in the UK and the US.",

      "description": "Dance-pop is dance-oriented pop music genre that originated in the early 1980s. It is generally up-tempo music intended for nightclubs with the intention of being danceable but also suitable for contemporary hit radio. Developing from post-disco, new wave, synthpop, electropop and house, it is generally characterised by strong beats with easy, uncomplicated song structures which are generally more similar to pop music than the more free-form dance genre, with an emphasis on melody as well as catchy tunes. The genre, on the whole, tends to be producer-driven, despite some notable exceptions. Dance-pop borrowed influences from other genres, which varied by producer, artist and period. Such include contemporary R&B, house, electro, trance, techno, electropop, new jack swing, funk, synthpop, and some forms of disco. Being mostly a mainstream pop-influenced genre, dance-pop's sound was often influenced by the period. Dance-pop is a popular style and there are several artists and groups who perform in the genre. Notable ones include Demi Lovato, Ariana Grande, Madonna, Michael Jackson, Britney Spears, Janet Jackson, Lady Gaga, New Kids on the Block, Heidi Montag, Gloria Estefan, Rick Astley, Celine Dion, George Michael, Kylie Minogue, Jennifer Lopez, Paula Abdul, Information Society, Backstreet Boys, Destiny's Child, Spice Girls, NSYNC, Christina Aguilera, Leah Luv, Little Mix and Clean Bandit.",

      "description": "Jazz is a music genre that originated from African American communities of New Orleans in the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz spans a period of over a hundred years, encompassing a very wide range of music, making it difficult to define. Jazz makes heavy use of improvisation, polyrhythms, syncopation and the swing note, as well as aspects of European harmony, American popular music, the brass band tradition, and African musical elements such as blue notes and African-American styles such as ragtime. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the music as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \"one of America's original art forms\". As jazz spread around the world, it drew on different national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to many distinctive styles. New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass-band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation. In the 1930s, heavily arranged dance-oriented swing big bands, Kansas City jazz, a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational style and Gypsy jazz (a style that emphasized musette waltzes) were the prominent styles. Bebop emerged in the 1940s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music towards a more challenging \"musician's music\" which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation. Cool jazz developed in the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer, smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines. The 1950s saw the emergence of free jazz, which explored playing without regular meter, beat and formal structures, and in the mid-1950s, hard bop emerged, which introduced influences from rhythm and blues, gospel, and blues, especially in the saxophone and piano playing. Modal jazz developed in the late 1950s, using the mode, or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation. Jazz-rock fusion appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s, combining jazz improvisation with rock music's rhythms, electric instruments and the highly amplified stage sound. In the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called smooth jazz became successful, garnering significant radio airplay. Other styles and genres abound in the 2000s, such as Latin and Afro-Cuban jazz.",

      "description": "Psychobilly is a fusion genre of rock music that mixes elements of punk rock, rock and roll, rockabilly, and rhythm and blues. It is one of several subgenres of rockabilly which also include thrashabilly, punkabilly, surfabilly and gothabilly. Merriam-Webster defines it as \"music that blends punk rock and rockabilly\"; another dictionary defines it as \"loud frantic rockabilly music.\" About.com defines psychobilly as \"tak[ing] the traditional countrified rock style known as rockabilly, ramp[ing] up its speed to a sweaty pace, and combin[ing] it with punk rock and imagery lifted from horror films and late-night sci-fi schlock,...[creating a] gritty honky tonk punk rock.\" Psychobilly, \"while rooted in the twang of rockabilly, owes just as much to the sound of straight up three-chord punk, often with a dose of thrash metal.\" Psychobilly is often characterized by lyrical references to science fiction, horror and exploitation films, violence, lurid sexuality, and other topics generally considered taboo, though often presented in a comedic or tongue-in-cheek fashion. Psychobilly bands and lyrics usually take an apolitical stance, a reaction to the right- and left-wing political attitudes which divided other British youth cultures. It is often played with an upright double bass, instead of the electric bass which is more common in modern rock music, and the hollowbody electric guitar, rather than the solid-bodied electric guitars that predominate in rock. Many psychobilly bands are trios of electric guitar, upright bass and drums, with one of the instrumentalists doubling as vocalist. Psychobilly gained underground popularity in Europe beginning in the early 1980s, with the UK band The Meteors, but remained largely unknown in the United States until the late 1990s. The second wave of psychobilly began with the 1986 release of British band Demented Are Go's debut album In Sickness & In Health. The genre soon spread throughout Europe, inspiring a number of new acts such as Mad Sin (formed in Germany in 1987) and the Nekromantix (formed in Denmark in 1989), who released the album Curse of the Coffin in 1991. Since then the advent of several notable psychobilly bands, such as the US band Tiger Army and the Australian band The Living End, has led to its mainstream popularity and attracted international attention to the genre.",

It was named by Nigerian multi-instrumentalist and bandleader Fela Kuti, who is responsible for the creation of the style and spreading the genre outside of Nigeria. Fela used it to revolutionize musical structure as well as the political context in his country, Nigeria. It was Kuti who coined the term \"afrobeat\" upon his return from a U.S. tour with his group Nigeria '70 (formerly Koola Lobitos). Afrobeat features chants, call-and-response vocals, and complex, interacting rhythms. The new sound hailed from a club that he established called the Afrika Shrine. Upon arriving in Nigeria, Kuti also changed the name of his group to Africa '70. The band maintained a five-year residency in the Afrika Shrine from 1970 to 1975 while afrobeat thrived among Nigerian youth. Afrobeat is now one of the most recognizable music genres in the world and has influenced as many Western musicians as it has African ones with its exuberant style and polyrhythms.",

It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards. Hard rock developed into a major form of popular music in the 1970s, with bands such as Led Zeppelin, The Who, Deep Purple, Aerosmith, AC/DC and Van Halen. During the 1980s, some hard rock bands moved away from their hard rock roots and more towards pop rock, while others began to return to a hard rock sound. Established bands made a comeback in the mid-1980s and it reached a commercial peak in the 1980s, with glam metal bands like Bon Jovi and Def Leppard and the rawer sounds of Guns N' Roses, which followed up with great success in the later part of that decade. Hard rock began losing popularity with the commercial success of grunge and later Britpop in the 1990s. Despite this, many post-grunge bands adopted a hard rock sound and in the 2000s there came a renewed interest in established bands, attempts at a revival, and new hard rock bands that emerged from the garage rock and post-punk revival scenes. In the 2000s, only a few hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers.",

The term \"outsider dance\" was first coined in 2012 by DJ Ben UFO and music journalist Scott Wilson, referring to different producers and record labels \"operating at the fringes of the fringes\" such as Pan Records artists including Laurel Halo and Hemlock Records, owned by Untold. L.I.E.S., Opal Tapes, 1080p, Workshop, and Lobster Theremin are the go-to labels for Outsider House as the genre has risen in prominence. Outsider house is also closely related to technoise, a fusion of techno and noise music.

      "description": "Freakbeat is a term sometimes used by record enthusiasts to describe the music of certain harder-driving British rock bands, often those with a mod following during the Swinging London period of the mid to late 1960s. Though it is most often used to describe many lesser known British bands of the era, such as The Creation and The Action, it can also apply to some of the more famous acts, such as The Who or Small Faces. It is sometimes seen as the British counterpart to the garage and psychedelic rock of American groups, such as The Seeds. Freakbeat music was typically created by four and five piece bands. Elements of the freakbeat style include strong direct drum beats, loud and frenzied guitar riffs, and effects such as fuzztone. The term is also sometimes used to refer to bands from Continental Europe during the era. The term was coined in the 1980s by the music journalist Phil Smee to retroactively describe the music style which has been described as a missing link between the early-to-mid-1960s R&B scene and the psychedelic rock and progressive rock genres that emerged in the late 1960s with bands such as Pink Floyd. Some of the best-known examples include \"Take a Heart\" by The Sorrows, \"Making Time\" by The Creation, \"Atmospheres\" by Wimple Winch and arguably \"I Can Hear the Grass Grow\" by The Move. Much of the material collected on Rhino Records's 2001 box-set compilation Nuggets II: Original Artyfacts from the British Empire and Beyond, 1964-1969 can be classified as freakbeat.",

Therefore, imayō, which was promoted by Emperor Go-Shirakawa in the Heian period, was a kind of ryūkōka. Today, however, ryūkōka refers specifically to Japanese popular music from the late 1920s through the early 1960s. Some of the roots of ryūkōka were developed from Western classical music. Ryūkōka ultimately split into two genres: enka and poppusu. Unlike enka, archetypal ryūkōka songs did not use the kobushi method of singing. Ryūkōka used legato. Bin Uehara and Yoshio Tabata are considered to be among the founders of the modern style of kobushi singing. Many composers and singers of ryūkōka went on to earn official distinctions; Ichiro Fujiyama and composers Masao Koga and Ryoichi Hattori received the People's Honour Award in later years. Although enka branched off from ryūkōka, many singers of the latter genre proclaimed strong disdain for its stylistic descendant. In a 1981 interview, Noriko Awaya said \"Whenever I hear enka, I have to get away from the music because I feel like vomiting.\"",

      "description": "Pagode ([paˈɡɔdʒi]) is a Brazilian style of music which originated in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil[citation needed], as a subgenre of Samba. Pagode originally meant a celebration with much food, music, dance and party. In 1978, singer Beth Carvalho was introduced to this music, liked it from the beginning and recorded tracks by Zeca Pagodinho and others. Over time, \"Pagode\" has been used by many commercial groups who have included a version of the music filled with clichés, and there is now a sentiment that the term is a pejorative for \"very commercial pop music\" (see Pagode Romântico). Original Pagode developed at the beginning of the 1980s, with the advent of the band Fundo de Quintal and the introduction of new instruments in the classical samba formation. Pagode lyricism also represented a kind of evolution towards the tradition of malicious and ironic samba lyrics, with a much heavier use of slang and underground terms. The 4-string banjo, whose introduction is mostly credited to Almir Guineto, has a different and louder sound than the cavaco; that loudness was an advantage in acoustic environments (samba circle), where there are many percussion instruments and people singing along. The 4-string banjo is one of the most characteristic instruments of the pagode sound. The tan-tan, whose introduction is credited to Sereno, is a more dynamic type of surdo, used to keep the main beat of the samba, the `heart of the samba', and played with the hands. The hand-repique, whose introduction is credited to Ubirany, is a percussive instrument used specially for rhythmic turnarounds.",

      "description": "Michael Haydn's Symphony No. 36 in B-flat major, Perger 28, Sherman 36, MH 475, written in Salzburg in 1788, is the last B-flat major symphony he wrote, the third of his final set of six symphonies. Scored for 2 oboes, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, timpani and strings. It is perhaps the first symphony in B-flat major to use trumpets and drums, something which is thought to have been pioneered by Joseph Haydn (see Symphony No. 98). This symphony is in three movements: The first movement, in sonata form, has for its first theme one of Haydn's most triadic themes, with the first violins not playing a note outside of the tonic chord until bar 13. The second theme (starting at bar 40) is by contrast extremely scalar, moving primarily in seconds. The development uses a new theme to lead back to the recapitulation. Unlike Haydn's other slow movements in symphonies with trumpets and timpani, the timpani are not silent in this one (see Joseph Haydn's Symphony No. 88). Bassoons and oboes take turns doubling the first violins on the melody. The melody is for the most part entrusted to the first violins, but the first bassoon often doubles it an octave below (while the second bassoon sticks to the usual duty of doubling the cello line in unison). The third movement, a rondo, features dramatic contrasts of piano and forte in its main theme."

      "description": "Facing Goya (2000) is an opera in four acts by Michael Nyman on a libretto by Victoria Hardie. It is an expansion of their one-act opera called Vital Statistics from 1987, dealing with such subjects as physiognomy and its practitioners, and also incorporates a musical motif from Nyman's art song, \"The Kiss\", inspired by a Paul Richards painting. Nyman also considers the work thematically tied to his other works, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, The Ogre, and Gattaca, though he does not quote any of these musically, save a very brief passage of the latter. It was premièred at the Auditorio de Galicia, Santiago de Compostela, Spain on 3 August 2000. The revision with the cast heard on the album premiered at the Badisches Straatstheater in Karlsruhe, Germany, on October 19, 2002. Vital Statistics has been withdrawn. The Santiago version included more material from Vital Statistics. The opera was most recently performed at the 2014 Spoleto Festival USA, located in Charleston, South Carolina. The expanded opera deals with the elitism and prejudice of various movements in pseudosciences and art criticism, wrapped around a thread of a desire to make a clone of Francisco Goya through use of his long-lost skull, which he hid from the likes of Paul Broca, and which the Art Banker finds under a floorboard in a \"degenerate art\" gallery in Act II. This skull is the object of numerous fights in the second and third acts, often with one character snatching it from another. The opera is non-realistic in its presentation, with only one through-character, the Art Banker. Indeed, when Goya does appear, it is not the result of cloning, but a purely fantastical device. Four other performers play different roles in each section who are thematically connected. In addition, two actors are called for in non-speaking roles. The Art Banker also speaks narration into a dictaphone, but this was omitted from the studio recording, though the lines are reprinted in the booklet."

It combines many elements of techno, hi-NRG, house music and Euro disco. Eurodance production continues to evolve with a more modernized style that incorporates elements from electro music. This genre of music is heavily influenced by the use of rich melodic vocals, either exclusively by itself or inclusively with rapped verses. This, combined with cutting-edge synthesizer, strong bass rhythm and melodic hooks, establishes the core foundation of Eurodance music. It peaked at Ibiza's summer festivals of 1994 in Spain and its intense popularity then spread around the world, which carried on into late 1997.",

Bubblegum's classic period ran from 1967 to 1972. A second wave of bubblegum started two years later and ran until 1977 when disco took over and punk rock emerged. The genre was predominantly a singles phenomenon rather than an album-oriented one. Also, because many acts were manufactured in the studio using session musicians, a large number of bubblegum songs were by one-hit wonders. Among the best-known acts of bubblegum's golden era are 1910 Fruitgum Company, The Ohio Express and The Archies, an animated group which had the most successful bubblegum song with \"Sugar, Sugar\", Billboard Magazine's No. 1 single for 1969. Singer Tommy Roe, arguably, had the most bubblegum hits of any artist during this period, notably 1969's \"Dizzy\".",

It has been described as \"Europe's alternative choice in the second half of the '90s\", and \"a fusion of hip hop and electronica until neither genre is recognisable\". Trip hop music fuses several styles and has much in common with other genres; it has several qualities similar to ambient music, and its drum-based breakdowns share characteristics with hip hop. It also contains elements of R&B, dub and house, as well as other electronic music. Trip hop can be highly experimental.",

DJ Screw is largely recognized as the innovator behind the chopped and screwed genre. DJ Screw's key technique involved playing the same record on both turntables with a delay between them of one beat, and quickly moving the crossfader side to side. This created an effect where words or sounds would be repeated in the music but would still keep the tempo going.

      "description": "Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\" was becoming more popular.In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex. The term rhythm and blues has undergone a number of shifts in meaning. In the early 1950s it was frequently applied to blues records. Starting in the mid-1950s, after this style of music contributed to the development of rock and roll, the term \"R&B\" became used to refer to music styles that developed from and incorporated electric blues, as well as gospel and soul music. In the 1960s, several British rock bands such as the Rolling Stones, The Who and The Animals were referred to and promoted as being RnB bands; posters for The Who's residency at the Marquee Club in 1964 contained the slogan . This tangent of RnB is now known as \"British rhythm and blues\". By the 1970s, the term rhythm and blues changed again and was used as a blanket term for soul and funk. In the 1980s, a newer style of R&B developed, becoming known as \"Contemporary R&B\". It combines elements of rhythm and blues, soul, funk, pop, hip hop and dance. Popular R&B vocalists at the end of the 20th century included Michael Jackson, R. Kelly, Stevie Wonder, Whitney Houston, and Mariah Carey.",

It was pioneered by musicians including the Beatles, the Beach Boys, the Byrds, and the Yardbirds, emerging as a genre during the mid-1960s among folk rock and blues rock bands in the United Kingdom and United States, such as Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Cream, the Doors and Pink Floyd. It reached a peak in between 1967 and 1969 with the Summer of Love and Woodstock Rock Festival, respectively, becoming an international musical movement and associated with a widespread counterculture, before beginning a decline as changing attitudes, the loss of some key individuals and a back-to-basics movement, led surviving performers to move into new musical areas. Psychedelic rock influenced the creation of psychedelic pop and psychedelic soul. It also bridged the transition from early blues- and folk music-based rock to progressive rock, glam rock, hard rock and as a result influenced the development of subgenres such as heavy metal. Since the late 1970s it has been revived in various forms of neo-psychedelia.",

      "description": "Industrial music is a genre of experimental/electronic music that draws on transgressive and provocative themes. The term was coined in the mid-1970s with the founding of Industrial Records by Genesis P-Orridge of Throbbing Gristle and Monte Cazazza; on Throbbing Gristle's debut album The Second Annual Report, they coined the slogan \"industrial music for industrial people\". In general, the style is harsh and challenging. AllMusic defines industrial as the \"most abrasive and aggressive fusion of rock and electronic music\"; \"initially a blend of avant-garde electronics experiments (tape music, musique concrète, white noise, synthesizers, sequencers, etc.) and punk provocation\". The first industrial artists experimented with noise and aesthetically controversial topics, musically and visually, such as fascism, serial killers and the occult. Their production was not limited to music, but included mail art, performance art, installation pieces and other art forms. Prominent industrial musicians include Throbbing Gristle, Monte Cazazza, SPK, Boyd Rice, Cabaret Voltaire, and Z'EV. The precursors that influenced the development of the genre included acts such as electronic group Kraftwerk, experimental rock acts such as The Velvet Underground and Frank Zappa, psychedelic rock artists such as Jimi Hendrix, and composers such as John Cage. Musicians also cite writers such as William S. Burroughs, and philosophers such as Friedrich Nietzsche as influences. While the term was initially self-applied by a small coterie of groups and individuals associated with Industrial Records in the 1970s, it broadened to include artists influenced by the original movement or using an \"industrial\" aesthetic. These artists expanded the genre by pushing it into noisier and more electronic directions. Over time, its influence spread into and blended with styles including ambient and rock, all of which now fall under the post-industrial music label. Electro-industrial music is a primary subgenre that developed in the 1980s. The two other most notable hybrid genres are industrial rock and industrial metal, which include bands such as Nine Inch Nails and Ministry, both of which released platinum-selling albums in the 1990s. These three distinct genres are often referred to as simply industrial.",

The term was coined by music industry entrepreneur Kedar Massenburg during the late 1990s to market and describe a style of music that emerged from soul and contemporary R&B. Heavily based in soul music, neo soul is distinguished by a less conventional sound than its contemporary R&B counterpart, with incorporated elements ranging from jazz, funk, and hip hop to pop, fusion, and African music. It has been noted by music writers for its traditional R&B influences, conscious-driven lyrics, and strong female presence. Neo soul developed during the 1980s and early 1990s, in the United States and United Kingdom, as a soul revival movement. It earned mainstream success during the 1990s, with the commercial and critical breakthroughs of several artists, including D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, and Maxwell. Their music was marketed as an alternative to the producer-driven, digitally approached R&B of the time. Since its initial mainstream popularity and impact on the sound of contemporary R&B, neo soul has been expanded and diversified musically through the works of both African-American and international artists. Its mainstream presence declined during the 2000s, although newer artists emerged through more independent means of marketing their music. According to music journalist Mark Anthony Neal, \"neo-soul and its various incarnations has helped to redefine the boundaries and contours of black pop.\"",

      "description": "Krautrock is a name now given to a supposed genre of rock and electronic music that originated in Germany in the late 1960s with a tendency towards improvisation on minimalistic arrangements. The term was originated, briefly and jokingly, by Melody Maker journalists. Although it was rejected by the musicians themselves and soon dropped, the German media later started to use it as a term for all German rock bands from the late 1960s and 1970s, while abroad the term was resurrected specifically to refer to more experimental artists who often used synthesizers and other electronic instruments. The term is a result of the English-speaking world's reception of the music at the time and not a reference to any one particular scene, style, or movement, as many krautrock artists were not familiar with one another. BBC DJ John Peel in particular is largely credited with spreading the reputation of krautrock outside of the German-speaking world.[citation needed] Largely divorced from the traditional blues and rock and roll influences of British and American rock music up to that time, the period contributed to the evolution of electronic music and ambient music as well as the birth of post-punk, alternative rock and new-age music. Key artists associated with the tag include Can, Amon Düül II, Ash Ra Tempel, Faust, Popol Vuh, Cluster, Harmonia, Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze, Neu! and Kraftwerk.",

      "description": "Garage rock is a style of pop music, a raw and energetic variety of rock and roll that flourished in the mid-1960s most notably in the United States and Canada, but also elsewhere. At the time it had no specific name and was not recognized as a separate genre, but critical recognition in the early 1970s, and particularly the release of the 1972 compilation album, Nuggets, did much to define and memorialize the style. The term derives from the perception that groups were often young amateurs who rehearsed in the family garage, though many were professional. The style, a precursor to psychedelic rock, is characterized by sometimes aggressive and unsophisticated lyrics and delivery, often using guitars distorted through a fuzzbox. Surf rock and subsequently the Beatles and the beat groups of the British Invasion motivated thousands to form bands in the US and elsewhere from 1963 through early 1968. Hundreds produced regional hits, and a handful had national chart hits. With the advent of psychedelia, a number of garage bands incorporated exotic elements into the genre's primitive stylistic framework, but after 1968, as more sophisticated forms of rock music emerged, garage rock records largely disappeared from the national and regional charts. In the early 1970s, some critics began to refer to the style as \"punk rock\", the first form of music to bear this description; and it is sometimes called \"garage punk\", \"protopunk\", or '60s punk\" to distinguish it from the more commonly known punk rock of the mid- and late-1970s that it influenced. Garage rock has experienced various revivals over the last several decades and continues to influence many modern acts who prefer a \"back to basics\" musical approach.",

      "description": "Blues is a genre and musical form that originated in African-American communities in the \"Deep South\" of the United States around the end of the 19th century. The genre developed from roots in traditional African music, combined with European American folk music. Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, and chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. The blue notes (or \"worried notes\") which are often thirds or fifths which are flatter in pitch than in other music styles, are also an important part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect called a groove. Blues as a genre possesses other characteristics such as lyrics, bass lines, and instruments. The lyrics of early traditional blues verses consisted of a single line repeated four times. It was only in the first decades of the 20th century that the most common current structure became standard: the so-called AAB pattern, consisting of a line sung over the four first bars, its repetition over the next four, and then a longer concluding line over the last bars. Early blues frequently took the form of a loose narrative, often relating troubles experienced within African American society. Many elements, such as the call-and-response format and the use of blue notes, can be traced back to the music of Africa. The origins of the blues are also closely related to the religious music of the Afro-American community, the spirituals. The first appearance of the blues is often dated to after the ending of slavery and, later, the development of juke joints. It is associated with the newly acquired freedom of the former slaves. Chroniclers began to report about blues music at the dawn of the 20th century. The first publication of blues sheet music was in 1908. Blues has since evolved from unaccompanied vocal music and oral traditions of slaves into a wide variety of styles and subgenres. Blues subgenres include country blues, such as Delta and Piedmont, as well as urban blues styles such as Chicago and West Coast blues. World War II marked the transition from acoustic to electric blues and the progressive opening of blues music to a wider audience, especially white listeners. In the 1960s and 1970s, a hybrid form called blues rock evolved.",

      "description": "House music is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in Chicago in the early 1980s. It was initially popularized in Chicago, circa 1984. House music quickly spread to other American cities such as Detroit, New York City, and Newark – all of which developed their own regional scenes. In the mid-to-late 1980s, house music became popular in Europe as well as major cities in South America, and Australia. Early house music commercial success in Europe saw songs such as \"Pump Up The Volume\" by MARRS (1987), \"House Nation\" by House Master Boyz and the Rude Boy of House (1987), \"Theme from S'Express\" by S'Express (1988) and \"Doctorin' the House\" by Coldcut (1988) in the pop charts. Since the early to mid-1990s, house music has been infused in mainstream pop and dance music worldwide. Early house music was generally dance-based music characterized by repetitive 4/4 beats, rhythms mainly provided by drum machines, off-beat hi-hat cymbals, and synthesized basslines. While house displayed several characteristics similar to disco music, it was more electronic and minimalistic, and the repetitive rhythm of house was more important than the song itself. House music in the 2010s, while keeping several of these core elements, notably the prominent kick drum on every beat, varies widely in style and influence, ranging from the soulful and atmospheric deep house to the more minimalistic microhouse. House music has also fused with several other genres creating fusion subgenres, such as euro house, tech house, electro house and jump house. In the late 1980s, many local Chicago house music artists suddenly found themselves presented with major label deals. House music proved to be a commercially successful genre and a more mainstream pop-based variation grew increasingly popular. Artists and groups such as Madonna, Janet Jackson, Paula Abdul, Aretha Franklin, Bananarama, Diana Ross, Tina Turner, Whitney Houston, Steps, Kylie Minogue, Bjork, and C+C Music Factoryhave all incorporated the genre into some of their work. After enjoying significant success in the early to mid-90s, house music grew even larger during the second wave of progressive house (1999–2001). The genre has remained popular and fused into other popular subgenres, for example, G-house, Deep House, Tech House and Bass House. As of 2015, house music remains extremely popular in both clubs and in the mainstream pop scene while retaining a foothold on underground scenes across the globe.[citation needed]",

      "description": "Neo-progressive rock (or often shortened to neo-prog, not to be confused with the significantly more modern new prog) is a subgenre of progressive rock, developed in the UK and popular in the 1980s, although it lives on today. Neo-progressive rock is characterized by deeply emotional content, often delivered via dramatic lyrics and a generous use of imagery and theatricality on-stage. The music is mostly the product of careful composition, relying less heavily on improvised jamming. The subgenre relies very much on clean, melodic & emotional electric guitar solos, combined with keyboards. The main musical influences on the neo-prog genre are bands from the first wave of progressive rock such as early Genesis, Camel, and to a lesser extent, Van der Graaf Generator and Pink Floyd. Funk, hard rock and punk rock were also influences on the genre. By some fans of progressive rock, neo-prog is criticised for lacking originality compared to earlier progressive rock - even by such artists as Robert John Godfrey of The Enid, whose own band has sometimes been promoted by neo-prog fans. In the book \"The Progressive Rock Files\", author Jerry Lucky dedicates a chapter to neo-progressive rock with the title \"A Neo Beginning!\", stating that this subgenre \"surfaced in late 1981, bearing testimony to the lasting values of this musical form\" of progressive rock, but distinguishing it from this main genre by going on to say that \"Sure the sound was a bit different ... a little more bite, a little more eighties\". Later in the same book, Jerry Lucky suggested that this subgenre of progressive rock peaked in the mid-1980s: \"As 1984 dawned all of the British neo-progressive rock bands release material. Marillion's second Fugazi, Pallas' The Sentinel, Pendragon's Fly High Fall Far, Twelfth Night's Art and Illusion, Solstice's Silent Dance, Quasar's Fire in the Sky and plenty of others including records from Haze C'est La Vie, Craft, Mach One Lost For Words, BJH Victims of Circumstance, The Enid The Spell, and others\". Early neo-prog was marked by sophisticated lyrics and often dark themes. While the accessibility of neo-prog to the mainstream is debatable, the form did generally seem more radio-friendly, with shorter and less complex songs than earlier progressive rock. Nonetheless, neo-prog never achieved the heights of popular success that the first wave of progressive rock in the 1970s did, with only one band, Marillion, achieving arena status. Marillion achieved major success across Europe in particular and produced eight top ten UK albums between 1983 and 1994, peaking in popularity with their album Misplaced Childhood in 1985, which topped the UK album chart and produced two top five hit singles in the UK. The album has been called \"the cornerstone of the entire 'neo-prog' movement\". Following this peak, neo-prog declined in popularity as a genre, although several bands have continued to record and tour, with Marillion in particular maintaining a large cult following. Progressive rock has continued with genres such as new prog and the alternative rock band Radiohead's ambitious work has been credited with inspiring a revival of interest in progressive rock.",

      "description": "Dub is a genre of electronic music that grew out of reggae in the 1960s, and is commonly considered a subgenre, though it has developed to extend beyond the scope of reggae. Music in this genre consists predominantly of instrumental remixes of existing recordings and is achieved by significantly manipulating and reshaping the recordings, usually by removing the vocals from an existing music piece, and emphasizing the drum and bass parts (this stripped-down track is sometimes referred to as a 'riddim'). Other techniques include dynamically adding extensive echo, reverb, panoramic delay, and occasional dubbing of vocal or instrumental snippets from the original version or other works. Dub was pioneered by Osbourne \"King Tubby\" Ruddock, Lee \"Scratch\" Perry, Errol Thompson and others in the late 1960s. Similar experiments with recordings at the mixing desk outside of the dancehall environment were also done by producers Clive Chin and Herman Chin Loy. These producers, especially Ruddock and Perry, looked upon the mixing console as an instrument, manipulating tracks to come up with something new and different. Dub has influenced many genres of music, including rock (most significantly the subgenre of post-punk and other kinds of punk), pop, hip hop, disco, and later house, techno, ambient, electronic dance music, and trip hop. Dub has become a basis for the genres of jungle/drum and bass and dubstep. Traditional dub has survived and some of the originators, such as Lee \"Scratch\" Perry and Mad Professor, continue to produce new material.",

      "description": "Electro (short for either electro-funk, or electro-boogie) is a genre of electronic music and early hip hop directly influenced by the use of TR-808 drum machines, and funk. Records in the genre typically feature drum machines and heavy electronic sounds, usually without vocals, although if vocals are present they are delivered in a deadpan manner, often through electronic distortion such as vocoding and talkboxing. This is the main distinction between electro and previously prominent genres such as disco, in which the electronic sound was only part of the instrumentation. It also palpably deviates from its predecessor boogie for being less vocal-oriented and more focused on electronic beats produced by drum machines. Following the decline of disco music in the United States, electro emerged as a fusion of funk and New York boogie. Early hip hop and rap combined with German and Japanese electropop influences such as Kraftwerk and Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO) inspired the birth of electro. In 1982, producer Arthur Baker with Afrika Bambaataa released the seminal \"Planet Rock\" which was influenced by the Yellow Magic Orchestra using samples Kraftwerk and drum beats supplied by the TR-808. Planet Rock was followed later that year by another breakthrough electro record, Nunk by Warp 9. In 1983, Hashim created an electro funk sound which influenced Herbie Hancock, resulting in his hit single \"Rockit\". The early 1980s were electro's mainstream peak. By the mid 1980s, the genre moved away from its electronic and funk influences, using harder edged beats and rock samples, exemplified by Run DMC. Electro became popular again in the late 1990s with artists such as Anthony Rother and DJs such as Dave Clarke. A third wave of popularity occurred in 2007. Electro has branched out into subgenres, including \"electrocore\" and Skweee, which developed in Sweden and Finland.",

The name is a play on the country's name in Dutch (Nederland). An English translation could be Netherpop. Most of the Nederpop bands of this period had English-language songs or played only instrumentals, but some of the bands performed exclusively in the Dutch language. Many such were popular thanks to airplay over the offshore pirate radio stations targeting the Netherlands such as Mi Amigo, Veronica, Atlantis and Northsea International. During the early 1980s, the Nederpop term was revived to name the sudden growth of Dutch language pop music from the Netherlands. The revived meaning came about because of the huge success of Doe Maar. This success helped other bands to sing in Dutch and/or get the spot light.",

Metalcore is noted for its use of breakdowns, which are slow, intense passages that are conducive to moshing. Pioneering metalcore bands—such as Integrity, Earth Crisis and Converge, all of which had formed by 1990—are described as leaning more toward hardcore, with their style sometimes being called metallic hardcore, whereas later bands—such as Killswitch Engage, All That Remains, As I Lay Dying, Bullet for My Valentine, Parkway Drive and Underoath—are described as leaning more towards metal. Sepultura, who have been said to have \"helped to lay the groundwork\" in the 2000s, and Pantera, who influenced Trivium, Atreyu, Bleeding Through and Unearth, have been particularly influential to the development of metalcore in the 2000s. Some bands in the genre have achieved considerable commercial success in this period.",

      "description": "The mangue bit or manguebeat movement is a cultural movement created circa 1991 in the city of Recife in Northeast Brazil in reaction to the cultural and economical stagnation of the city. The movement largely focuses on music, mixing regional rhythms of Brazilian Northeast, such as maracatu, frevo, coco and forró, with rock, hip hop, funk and electronic music. The movement has its own manifesto, Caranguejos com Cérebro (or \"Crabs with Brains\" in English), written in 1992 by singer Fred 04 and DJ Renato L. Its title refers to Recife's inhabitants as crabs living in Recife's mangrove environment. A major symbol associated with mangue bit is that of an antenna stuck in the mud receiving signals from all over the world. Mangue bit can be divided into two distinct waves: the first in the early 1990s led by the music groups Chico Science & Nação Zumbi (Zumbi's Nation) and Mundo Livre S/A (Free World Inc.), and the second in the early 2000s led by Re:Combo (a copyleft movement that uploads half-sampled music for download) and Cordel do Fogo Encantado (a music group that started as a roving theatre troupe with roots in a form of literature known as literatura de cordel (\"twine literature\")). The original movement named itself mangue bit, mangue referring to Recife's mangroves and bit to the computer bit central to the movement's electronic music influences. Since then, mangue bit has far more commonly, albeit mistakenly, been referred as mangue beat.",

      "description": "Doo-wop is a genre of music that was developed in African-American communities in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Baltimore, Newark, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Detroit, Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles in the 1940s, achieving mainstream popularity in the 1950s and early 1960s. Built upon vocal harmony, doo-wop was one of the most mainstream, pop-oriented R&B styles of the time. Singer Bill Kenny (1914–1978) is often called the \"Godfather of Doo-wop\" for his introducing the \"top and bottom\" format which featured a high tenor singing the lead and a bass singer reciting the lyrics in the middle of the song. Doo-wop features vocal group harmony, nonsense syllables, a simple beat, sometimes little or no instrumentation, and simple music and lyrics. The first record to use the syllables \"doo-wop\" was the 1955 hit \"When You Dance\" by the Turbans. The term \"doo-wop\" first appeared in print in 1961. During the late 1950s many Italian-American groups contributed a significant part in the doo-wop scene. The peak of doo-wop was in 1961. Doo-wop's influence continued in soul, pop, and rock groups of the 1960s. At various times in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, the genre has seen revivals. Doo-wop was a precursor to many of the African-American musical styles seen today. An evolution of jazz and blues, doo-wop also influenced many of the major Rock and Roll groups that defined the later decades of the 20th century. Doo-wop is iconic for its swing-like beats and using the off-beat to keep time. Doo-wop laid the foundation for many musical innovations, for example, R&B.",

It also drew heavily on British invasion rock'n'roll, garage rock and Hollywood film soundtracks. The term is extremely broad, covering Thai rock, dance music, rap and western-influenced popular music in general. It normally excludes the folk rock phleng phuea chiwit.

      "description": "Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia. Building from the musical structure of thrash metal and early black metal, death metal emerged during the mid-1980s. Bands such as Venom, Celtic Frost, Slayer, and Kreator were important influences on the genre's creation. Possessed and Death, along with bands such as Obituary, Autopsy and Morbid Angel, are often considered pioneers of the genre. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, death metal gained more media attention as popular genre niche record labels like Combat, Earache, and Roadrunner, began to sign death metal bands at a rapid rate. Since then, death metal has diversified, spawning several subgenres. Melodic death metal combines death metal elements with those of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal. Technical death metal is a complex style, with uncommon time signatures, atypical rhythms and unusual harmonies and melodies. Death-doom combines the deep growled vocals and double-kick drumming of death metal with the slow tempos and melancholic atmosphere of doom metal. Deathgrind, goregrind and pornogrind mix the complexity of death metal with the intensity, speed, and brevity of grindcore. Deathcore combines death metal with metalcore traits. Death 'n' roll combines death metal's growled vocals and highly distorted, detuned guitar riffs with elements of 1970s hard rock and heavy metal.",

      "genre": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Symphony_in_G_minor_(Moeran)",
      "description": "The Symphony in G minor was the only completed symphony written by Ernest John Moeran. He wrote it in 1934–37. It is in four movements. In 1926, the conductor of the Hallé Orchestra, Sir Hamilton Harty, commissioned a symphony from Moeran. He had already been working on a symphony since 1924, and the premiere performance of the new work was announced for 4 March 1926. However, when it was almost finished, he decided he was not satisfied with its structure and withdrew it. Over the next eight years he worked on his revision of the piece, but in 1934 he abandoned his sketches and started again. He reused some earlier material, but the work was substantially new. The symphony was finished on 24 January 1937, and dedicated to Harty. Harty initially refused the dedication after he was overlooked as the conductor for the first performance (by now he was ill and had left the Hallé Orchestra). The work takes about 45 minutes to play, and is in four movements: The symphony is scored for 2 flutes (II takes piccolo), 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, percussion (triangle, tamtam, tenor drum, snare drum, bass drum, cymbals), harp, and strings. The symphony's first movement is a robust sonata form, with a questioning harmonic structure. Much of the work was written in County Kerry, Ireland, where Moeran spent most of this time, but the slow second movement was inspired by the sand dunes and marshes of East Norfolk, England, and may have its roots in Moeran's 1924 arrangement of a folk-song called The Shooting of His Dear (the 5th of his Six Songs from Norfolk). The first performance was on 13 January 1938 in the Queen's Hall, played by the Royal Philharmonic Society, conducted by Leslie Heward, whom Moeran considered to be the work's finest interpreter. It was played at a Prom Concert on 11 August 1938, with the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Sir Henry Wood. (It did not receive its second performance at the Proms until 23 July 2009, under Vassily Sinaisky.) The work and its orchestration show the influence of other composers, including Bax, Delius, Warlock, van Dieren, and most particularly Sibelius. The Scherzo begins and ends with a solo oboe, as does the Scherzo of Sibelius's 4th Symphony; there are echoes of Tapiola. The influence of folk elements is also apparent: Eric Blom said it contains \"a touch of dialect\". There are also jazz-influenced rhythms. The work was originally subject to considerable criticism, on the grounds that it was too derivative (Wilfrid Mellers said it could not have been written before Vaughan Williams had shown how to write a symphony), undisciplined and showed the composer's inexperience of symphonic form. By 1942, however, it had become accepted. In that year, Novello & Co published the symphony, and the British Council undertook a promotion of British culture overseas. The music section of the project was a recording of significant recent compositions by British composers, and Moeran's Symphony in G minor was the first work to be recorded. It was recorded in November/December 1942, in Manchester, with the Hallé Orchestra under Leslie Heward. The composer was present for some of the sessions (he proved to be a distraction, and it was suggested he let the musicians get on with their job without his \"assistance\"). Heward was already seriously ill with tuberculosis, and died only five months later. Other conductors to record Moeran's Symphony in G minor include Neville Dilkes (English Sinfonia, 1972), Sir Adrian Boult (New Philharmonia Orchestra, released 1975), Vernon Handley (Ulster Orchestra, 1987) and David Lloyd-Jones (Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, 2001). Moeran completed no more full symphonies. His three-movement Sinfonietta appeared in 1944, and an orchestral Serenade in 1948. He was working on a second symphony (in E♭) at the time of his death in 1950. The manuscript of that work and various others were donated by his widow Peers Coetmore to the Victorian College of the Arts in Melbourne, Australia."

      "description": "The Symphony No. 2 in F minor was written by Richard Strauss between 1883 and 1884. It is sometimes referred to as just Symphony in F minor. He gave it the Opus number 12, and it also appears in other catalogues as TrV 126 and Hanstein A.I.2. It is not listed in von Asow's catalog. The symphony, written for a standard orchestra consisting of 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets in B-flat, 2 bassoons, 4 horns in F, 2 trumpets in F and C, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, and strings, was premiered by Theodore Thomas conducting the New York Philharmonic on December 13, 1884. The European premiere, with Strauss himself conducting, took place in October 1885 (on the same night he was the soloist in Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 24, K. 491, with his own cadenza). In 1887 he played it again with the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra. The symphony is in the usual four movements, though the scherzo and slow movement are switched from their usual positions, as in Beethoven's Symphony No. 9: The first movement is a sonata form allegro with three themes. The ways Strauss develops his material in this symphony owes much to Beethoven's middle period music, in particular \"the slow movement of the Seventh Symphony (in the chromatically inflected stepwise descent at mm. 139—43 of the first movement), the development of the Eroica, first movement (repeated tutti pounding of a single dissonance, in movement one, mm. 193—99), and the Egmont Overture, this time in the same key (intensification through repetition of rising motive over dominant harmony, in movement four, mm. 346—49).\" The recapitulation section is unusual because it modulates to A-flat major for the second subject group rather than staying in tonic or going to the parallel major. The scherzo was successful and had to be repeated both times Strauss conducted the symphony in Milan in 1887. A transitional brass motif from the first movement intrudes in the lyricism of the slow movement. The main theme of the fourth movement is \"an agitated low-string melody rising beneath tremolo and sounding very much like Bruckner.\" Near the end, about halfway between rehearsal letters T and U, Strauss recalls themes from the previous three movements, though the Andante is recalled second and the Scherzo third. Bruckner's Symphony No. 3, in its 1873 version, also recalls themes from the previous movements in the finale at an analogous point. Johannes Brahms's initial reaction to the piece was two words: \"ganz hübsch\" (\"quite nice\"). Later he elaborated his advice, encouraging Strauss to \"take a good look at Schubert's dances,\" to guard against \"thematic irrelevances,\" and that there \"is no point in this piling up of many themes which are only contrasted rhythmically on a single triad.\" Béla Bartók's Concerto for Orchestra contains \"an interesting resemblance between a canon for trumpets and horns in three pairs a quaver apart in the slow movement and the canon for brass in the first movement,\" something which was first noticed by Theodore Bloomfield. Strauss recorded some of his own compositions, but this symphony was not among them. The few conductors to record this symphony are Michael Halasz, Neeme Järvi, Hiroshi Wakasugi. A version for piano duet has also been recorded."

      "description": "Reggae (/ˈrɛɡeɪ/) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term reggae more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento and calypso music, as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as ‘Rudie Blues’, then ‘Ska’, later ‘Blue Beat’, and ‘Rock Steady’. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. Stylistically, reggae incorporates some of the musical elements of rhythm and blues, jazz, mento (a celebratory, rural folk form that served its largely rural audience as dance music and an alternative to the hymns and adapted chanteys of local church singing), calypso, African music, as well as other genres. One of the most easily recognizable elements is offbeat rhythms; staccato chords played by a guitar or piano (or both) on the offbeats of the measure. The tempo of reggae is usually slower than ska but faster than rocksteady. The concept of \"call and response\" can be found throughout reggae music. The bass guitar often plays the dominant role in reggae. The bass sound in reggae is thick and heavy, and equalized so the upper frequencies are removed and the lower frequencies emphasized. The guitar in reggae usually plays on the off beat of the rhythm. It is common for reggae to be sung in Jamaican Patois, Jamaican English, and Iyaric dialects. Reggae is noted for its tradition of social criticism and religion in its lyrics, although many reggae songs discuss lighter, more personal subjects, such as love and socializing. Reggae has spread to many countries across the world, often incorporating local instruments and fusing with other genres. Reggae en Español spread from mainland South American Caribbean from Venezuela and Guyana to the rest of South America. Caribbean music in the United Kingdom, including reggae, has been popular since the late 1960s, and has evolved into several subgenres and fusions. Many reggae artists began their careers in the UK, and there have been a number of European artists and bands drawing their inspiration directly from Jamaica and the Caribbean community in Europe. Reggae in Africa was boosted by the visit of Bob Marley to Zimbabwe in 1980. In Jamaica, authentic reggae is one of the biggest sources of income.",

      "description": "Thrash metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music characterized by its fast tempo and overall aggression. The songs usually use fast percussive beats and low-register guitar riffs, overlaid with shredding-style lead work. The lyrics often deal with social issues and reproach for The Establishment, using direct and denunciatory language, an approach which partially overlaps with the hardcore genre. The genre evolved in the early 1980s from combining the fast drum beats and attitude of hardcore punk with the double bass drumming, heavy and complex guitar style of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal (NWOBHM). It emerged partially as a reaction to the more conventional and widely acceptable glam metal, a less aggressive, pop music-infused heavy metal subgenre which appeared simultaneously. Thrash metal was an inspiration for subsequent extreme genres such as death metal and black metal. Four American bands, Anthrax, Megadeth, Metallica, and Slayer, are credited with pioneering and popularizing the genre. The Clash of the Titans tour (1990–1991), which featured Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax, is considered the genre's pinnacle, after which thrash metal saw a decline in popularity throughout the decade. Thrash metal has seen a resurgence in recent times, with many of the older bands returning to their roots with their new releases.

      "description": "Hard trance is a subgenre of trance music that originated in Western Europe (Belgium, Germany, and Netherlands) in the early 1990s as the breakbeat hardcore production community began to diversify into new and different styles of electronic music, all influenced by UK hard house, happy hardcore and jungle/drum & bass. The popularity of hard trance peaked during the late 1990s, and has since then faded in scope of newer forms of Trance. Hard trance is often characterized by strong, hard (or even downpitch) kicks, fully resonant basses and an increased amount of reverberation applied to the main beat. Melodies vary from 140 to 180 in tempo, and can feature plain instrumental sound in early compositions, with the latter ones tending to implement side-chaining techniques of progressive on digital synthesizers. Hard trance was the final form of progressive to hit the mainstream. It eventually morphed into jumpstyle and hardstyle. Although hard trance is still made and listened to by many people today, its social appeal has undoubtedly waned considerably since the mid-2000s.[citation needed]",

      "description": "Hardcore punk (or simply hardcore) is a punk rock music genre and subculture that originated in the late 1970s. Hardcore punk music is generally faster, harder, and more abrasive than regular punk rock. The origin of the term \"hardcore punk\" is uncertain. The Vancouver-based band D.O.A. may have helped to popularize the term with the title of their 1981 album, Hardcore '81. A September 1981 article by Tim Sommer shows the author applying the term to the \"15 or so\" punk bands gigging around the city at that time, which he considered a belated development relative to LA, SF, and DC. Hardcore historian Steven Blush said that the term \"hardcore\" is also a reference to the sense of being \"fed up\" with the existing punk and new wave music. Blush also states that the term refers to \"an extreme: the absolute most Punk.\" The roots of hardcore can be traced back to San Francisco and Southern California. The former arose as a reaction against the dominant hippie scene and was inspired by the New York punk rock and the early protopunk scene. New York punk rock had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the major music industry and \"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\" and deals with social and political subjects. Hardcore sprouted underground scenes across the United States in the early 1980s, particularly in Washington, D.C., New York, New Jersey, and Boston—as well as in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. Hardcore has spawned the straight edge movement and its associated submovements, hardline and youth crew. Hardcore was heavily involved with the rise of the independent record labels in the 1980s, and with the DIY ethics in underground music scenes. It has influenced a number of music genres which have experienced mainstream success, such as alternative rock, grunge, alternative metal, metalcore, thrash metal, post-hardcore and certain elements[citation needed] of hip hop. While traditional hardcore has never experienced mainstream commercial success, some of its early pioneers have garnered appreciation over time. Black Flag's Damaged, Minutemen's Double Nickels on the Dime and Hüsker Dü's New Day Rising were included in Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003 and Dead Kennedys have seen one of their albums reach gold status over a period of 25 years. In 2011, Rolling Stone writer David Fricke placed Greg Ginn of Black Flag 99th place in his 100 Greatest Guitarists list. Although the music genre started in English-speaking western countries, notable hardcore scenes have existed in Italy, Brazil, Japan, Europe and the Middle East.",

      "description": "Sonata da camera is literally translated to mean 'chamber sonata' and is used to describe a group of instrumental pieces set into three or four different movements, beginning with a prelude, or small sonata, acting as an introduction for the following movements. The term sonata da camera originated from Rome in the late 17th century from when Arcangelo Corelli wrote two different variations of sonata. These became known as \"sonata da camera\" and \"sonata da chiesa\" respectively. In the Oxford History of Western Music, Richard Taruskin describes a sonata da camera as \"... essentially a dance suite, which Corelli adapted to the prevailing four-movement format (a 'preludio' and three dances or connecting movements).\" The following dance style movements were usually given names referring to the style, e.g., partita, suite, ordre, ouverture and air (as in English reprints of Corelli's chamber sonatas). The most frequent instrumentation in sonata da camera was two violins and a bass. Most harmonies were completed in the bass part whilst the two treble instruments played above. This was also known as a trio sonata, as this consisted of three major parts. But sometimes, a fourth player (usually a cellist) was required to double on the basso continuo line. However, recent scholarship has revealed the diversity of instruments used for the basso continuo line in Corelli's milieu, including theorbo, guitar and organ. An ambiguity on the title page of Corelli's set of sonatas has led many to conclude that the continuo would have been either a harpsichord or cello, rather than both as was previously assumed."

      "description": "Chamber jazz is a genre of jazz involving small, acoustic-based ensembles where group interplay is important. It is influenced aesthetically by musical neoclassicism and is often influenced by classical forms of Western music as well as non-Western music or culture. That stated, in many cases the influence is traditional Celtic music, Central European folk music, or Latin American music instead. The genre primarily began in Europe so significant neoclassical composers of Europe, like Igor Stravinsky, are important in it. The German ECM Records also played a role in it beginning in the late 1960s. It is also noted for using instruments not normally associated with jazz. For example, chamber jazz will make use of the oboe, mandolin, cymbalum, or the tabla. The non-Western influences or instrumentation make chamber jazz at times listed as a kind of world music. At other times the fusion of neoclassical with jazz is deemed to be New Age and several albums of chamber jazz were released by Windham Hill Records. Windham Hill itself was co-founded by a musician linked to chamber jazz and was initially known for folk or world music. The term is also used, on occasion, to simply mean the fusion of chamber music with jazz. In this case it means something similar to third stream, but without the orchestral aspect third stream leans toward.",

      "description": "Synthpop (also known as electropop and technopop) is a genre of popular music that first became prominent in the 1980s and features the synthesizer as the dominant musical instrument. It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in progressive rock, electronic art rock, disco and particularly the \"Krautrock\" of bands like Kraftwerk. It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the post-punk era as part of the new wave movement of the late-1970s to the mid-1980s. Early synthpop pioneers included Japanese group Yellow Magic Orchestra and British bands Ultravox and The Human League; the latter largely used monophonic synthesizers to produce music with a simple and austere sound. After the breakthrough of Gary Numan and his band Tubeway Army in the British Singles Chart in 1979, large numbers of artists began to enjoy success with a synthesizer-based sound in the early 1980s, including Soft Cell, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and Depeche Mode in the United Kingdom, while in Japan, Yellow Magic Orchestra's success opened the way for synthpop bands such as P-Model, Plastics, and Hikashu. The development of inexpensive polyphonic synthesizers, the definition of MIDI and the use of dance beats, led to a more commercial and accessible sound for synthpop. This, its adoption by the style-conscious acts from the New Romantic movement, together with the rise of MTV, led to success for large numbers of British synthpop acts, including Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet, in the United States. In the late 1980s, duos such as Erasure and Pet Shop Boys adopted a sound that was highly successful on the US dance charts, but by the end of the decade synthpop had largely been abandoned. Interest began to be revived in the indietronica and electroclash movements in the late 1990s and, in the first decade of the 21st century, it enjoyed a widespread revival with commercial success for acts including La Roux, Lady Gaga, Kesha, and Owl City. The genre has received criticism for alleged lack of emotion and musicianship; prominent artists have spoken out against detractors who believed that synthesizers themselves composed and played the songs. Some artists like Depeche Mode, who helped popularise the genre, were criticised for gender bending. Synthpop helped to establish the place of the synthesizer as a major element of pop and rock music, directly influenced subsequent genres including house music and Detroit techno, and has indirectly influenced many other genres and individual recordings.",

AllMusic defines it as follows: \"Alternative rap refers to hip hop groups that tend not to conform to any of the traditional forms of rap, such as gangsta, bass, hardcore, pop, and party rap. Instead, they blur genres – drawing equally from funk and rock, as well as jazz, soul, reggae, country, electronic, and even folk.\" Alternative hip hop developed in the late 1980s. Its commercial momentum was impeded by the then also newly emerging, significantly harder-edged West Coast gangsta rap. A resurgence came about in the late 1990s and early 2000s with the rejuvenated interest in indie music by the general public. In the 2000s alternative hip hop reattained its place within the mainstream, due in part to the declining commercial viability of gangsta rap as well as the crossover success of artists such as OutKast and Kanye West. The alternative hip hop movement expanded beyond the US to include the Somali-Canadian poet K'naan, Japanese rapper Shing02, and British artist MIA. Alternative hip hop acts have attained much critical acclaim, but receive relatively little exposure through radio and other media outlets.",

      "description": "New wave music is a musical genre of pop/rock created in the late 1970s to mid-1980s with ties to 1970s punk rock. The wide range of bands categorized under this term has been a source of much confusion and controversy. The new wave sound of the late 1970s moved away from the smooth blues and rock & roll sounds to create music with a twitchy, agitated feel, choppy rhythm guitars and fast tempos. Initially—as with the later post-punk—new wave was broadly analogous to punk rock before branching as a distinctly identified genre, incorporating electronic and experimental music, mod, disco and pop. It subsequently engendered subgenres and fusions, including synthpop, college rock and gothic rock. New wave differs from other movements with ties to first-wave punk as it displays characteristics common to pop music, rather than the more \"arty\" post-punk, though it incorporates much of the original punk rock sound and ethos while arguably exhibiting greater complexity in both music and lyrics. Common characteristics of new wave music, aside from its punk influences, include the use of synthesizers and electronic productions, the importance of styling and the arts, as well as a great amount of diversity. New wave has been called one of the definitive genres of the 1980s, after it grew partially fixated on MTV (The Buggles' \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" music video was broadcast as the first music video to promote the channel's launch), and the popularity of several new wave artists, attributing the exposure that was given to them by the channel. In the mid-1980s, differences between new wave and other music genres began to blur. New wave has enjoyed resurgences since the 1990s, after a rising \"nostalgia\" for several new wave-influenced artists. The revivals in the 1990s and early 2000s were small, but became popular by 2004; subsequently, the genre has influenced a variety of other music genres. During the 2000s, a number of acts explored new wave and post-punk influences, such as The Strokes, Interpol, Franz Ferdinand, and The Killers. These acts were sometimes labeled \"New New Wave\".",

      "description": "Jazz fusion or simply fusion is a musical genre that developed in the late 1960s when musicians combined aspects of jazz harmony and improvisation with styles such as funk, rock, rhythm and blues, and latin jazz. During this time many jazz musicians began experimenting with electric instruments and amplified sound for the first time. Electronic effects and keyboard synthesisers also featured. Many of the developments during the late 60s and early 70s have since become established elements of jazz fusion musical practice. Fusion arrangements vary in complexity, some employ groove based vamps fixed to a single key, or even a single chord, with a simple melodic motif (a lick). Others can feature odd or shifting time signatures with elaborate chord progressions, melodies, and counter-melodies. Typically, these arrangements, whether simple or complex, will feature extended improvised sections that can vary in length. As with jazz, fusion often employs brass instruments such as trumpet and saxophone as melody and soloing instruments but other instruments often substitute for these. The rhythm section typically consists of electric bass (in some cases fretless), electric guitar, electric piano/synthesizer (in contrast to the double bass and piano used in earlier jazz) and drums. As with traditional jazz improvisation, fusion instrumentalists generally require a high level of technical proficiency. The term \"jazz-rock\" is often used as a synonym for \"jazz fusion\" as well as for music performed by late 1960s and 1970s-era rock bands that added jazz elements to their music. It is different from the UK Canterbury Scene's progressive rock (\"prog\") and other forms of prog-jazz fusion, in which extended prog instrumentals use improvisation and take on a jazz-influenced feel. After a decade of popularity during the 1970s, fusion expanded its improvisatory and experimental approaches through the 1980s, in parallel with the development of a radio-friendly style called smooth jazz. Experimentation continued in the 1990s and 2000s. Fusion albums, even those that are made by the same group or artist, may include a variety of musical styles. Rather than being a codified musical style, fusion can be viewed as a musical tradition or approach.",

Detroit blues originated when Delta blues performers migrated north from the Mississippi Delta and Memphis, Tennessee to work in Detroit's industrial plants in the 1920s and 1930s. Typical Detroit blues was very similar to Chicago blues in style. The sound was distinguished from Delta blues by its use of electric amplified instruments and a more eclectic assortment of instruments, including the bass guitar and piano. The only Detroit blues performer to achieve national fame is John Lee Hooker, as record companies and promoters have tended to ignore the Detroit scene in favor of the larger, more influential Chicago blues. The Detroit scene was centered on Black Bottom, a Detroit neighborhood.",

      "description": "Gothic metal (or goth metal) is a subgenre of heavy metal and gothic rock that combines the heaviness of heavy metal with the dark atmospheres of gothic rock. The music of gothic metal is diverse with bands known to adopt the gothic approach to different styles of heavy metal music. The genre originated during the early 1990s in Europe originally as an outgrowth of death-doom, a fusion of death metal and doom metal. Lyrics are generally dark and introspective with inspiration from gothic fiction as well as personal experiences. Pioneers of gothic metal (although the bands themselves never claim the title of gothic-metal) include Paradise Lost, My Dying Bride and Anathema, all from the north of England. Other pioneers from the first half of the 1990s include Type O Negative from the United States, Tiamat from Sweden, and The Gathering from the Netherlands. Norwegian band Theatre of Tragedy developed the \"beauty and the beast\" aesthetic of combining aggressive male vocals with clean female vocals, a contrast that has since been adopted by many gothic metal groups before them but not as a regular trademark. During the mid-1990s, Moonspell, Theatres des Vampires and Cradle of Filth brought the gothic approach to black metal. By the end of the decade, a symphonic metal variant of gothic metal had been developed by Tristania, Nightwish and Within Temptation. In the 21st century, gothic metal has moved towards the mainstream in Europe, particularly in Finland where groups such as Entwine, HIM, Lullacry and Poisonblack have released hit singles or chart-topping albums. In the US, however, only a few bands such as Type O Negative, HIM, Lacuna Coil, Evanescence and Cradle of Filth have found some degree of commercial success.",

Although it comprises all genres of \"popular music\" within South Korea, the term is more often used in a narrower sense to describe a modern form of South Korean pop music covering a wide range of styles including dance-pop, pop ballad, electronic, rock, metal, hip-hop music and R&B. In 1992, modern K-pop was ushered in with the formation of Seo Taiji and Boys, whose successful experimentation with different music styles had sparked a paradigm shift in the music industry of South Korea. As a result, the integration of foreign musical elements has now become a common practice in the K-pop industry. First gaining popularity in East Asia in the late 1990s, K-pop entered the Japanese music market towards the turn of the 21st century. In the late 2000s, it grew from a musical genre into a subculture among teenagers and young adults of East and Southeast Asia. Currently, the spread of K-pop to other regions of the world, via the Korean Wave, is seen in parts of Latin America, Northeast India, North Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and immigrant enclaves of the Western world. Korean pop culture is becoming an increasingly global phenomenon, caused in part by the K-pop industry's adeptness at tapping into social networking services and the video sharing platform YouTube. Since the mid-2000s, the K-pop music market has experienced double digit growth rates. In the first half of 2012, it grossed nearly US$3.4 billion and was recognized by Time magazine as \"South Korea's Greatest Export\".",

      "description": "Progressive rock, also known as prog rock or prog, is a rock music subgenre that originated in the United Kingdom with further developments in Germany, Italy, and France, throughout the mid-to-late 1960s and 1970s. It developed from psychedelic rock, and originated as an attempt to give greater artistic weight and credibility to rock music. Bands abandoned the short pop single in favor of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz or classical music in an effort to give rock music the same level of musical sophistication and critical respect. Progressive rock sometimes abandons the danceable beat that defines earlier rock styles and is more likely to experiment with compositional structure, instrumentation, harmony, rhythm, and lyrical content. It may demand more effort on the part of the listener than other types of music. Musicians in progressive rock typically display a high degree of instrumental skill. Musical forms are blurred through the use of extended sections and of musical interludes that bridge separate sections, which results in classical-style suites. Early progressive rock groups expanded the timbral palette of the then-traditional rock instrumentation by adding instruments more typical of folk, jazz, or music in the classical tradition. A number of bands, especially at the genre's onset, recorded albums in which they performed with full orchestras.Progressive rock artists are more likely to explore complex time signatures such as 5/8 and 7/8. Tempo, key, and time signature changes are common within progressive rock compositions. Songs were replaced by musical suites that often stretched to 20 or 40 minutes in length and contained symphonic influences, extended musical themes, philosophical, mystical and/or surreal lyrics, and complex orchestrations. The genre was not without criticism, however, as some reviewers found the concepts \"pretentious\" and the sounds \"pompous\" and \"overblown\". Progressive rock saw a high level of popularity throughout the 1970s, especially in the middle of the decade. Bands such as Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, the Moody Blues, Yes, King Crimson, Genesis, Camel and Emerson, Lake & Palmer (ELP) were the genre's most influential groups and were among the most popular acts of the era, although there were many other, often highly influential, bands who experienced a lesser degree of commercial success. The genre faded in popularity during the second half of the decade. Conventional wisdom holds that the rise of punk rock caused this, although in reality a number of factors contributed to the decline. Progressive rock bands achieved commercial success well into the 1980s, albeit with changed lineups and more compact song structures. The genre grew out of the 1960s space rock of Pink Floyd and the classical rock experiments of bands such as the Moody Blues, Procol Harum and the Nice. Most of the prominent bands from the genre's 1970s heyday fall into the \"symphonic prog\" category, in which classical orchestrations and compositional techniques are melded with rock music. Other subgenres exist, including the more accessible neo-progressive rock of the 1980s, the jazz-influenced Canterbury sound of the 1960s and 1970s, and the more political and experimental Rock in Opposition movement of the late 1970s and onward. Progressive rock has influenced genres such as krautrock and post-punk, and it has fused with other forms of rock music to create such subgenres as neo-classical metal and progressive metal. A revival, often known as , occurred at the turn of the 21st century and has since enjoyed a cult following.",

Salsa is the product of various musical genres including the Cuban son montuno, guaracha, chachachá, mambo, and to a certain extent bolero, and the the Puerto Rican bomba and plena. Latin jazz, which was also developed in New York City, has had a significant influence on salsa arrangers, piano guajeos, and instrumental soloists. Salsa is primarily Cuban son, itself a fusion of Spanish canción and guitar and Afro-Cuban percussion, merged with North American music styles such as jazz. Salsa also occasionally incorporates elements of rock, R&B, and funk. All of these non-Cuban elements are grafted onto the basic Cuban son montuno template when performed within the context of salsa. The first salsa bands were predominantly \"Nuyorican\" (New Yorkers of Puerto Rican descent) or Puerto Ricans who moved to New York. The music eventually spread throughout Colombia and the rest of the Americas. Ultimately, it became a global phenomenon. Some of the founding salsa artists were Johnny Pacheco (the creator of the Fania All-Stars), Ray Barretto, Willie Colón, Larry Harlow, Roberto Roena, Bobby Valentín, Eddie Palmieri, and Héctor Lavoe.",

      "description": "Hip hop music, also called hip-hop or rap music, is a music genre formed in the United States in the 1970s that consists of a stylized rhythmic music that commonly accompanies rapping, a rhythmic and rhyming speech that is chanted. It developed as part of hip hop culture, a subculture defined by four key stylistic elements: MCing/rapping, DJing/scratching, break dancing, and graffiti writing. Other elements include sampling (or synthesis), and beatboxing. While often used to refer to rapping, \"hip hop\" more properly denotes the practice of the entire subculture. The term hip hop music is sometimes used synonymously with the term rap music, though rapping is not a required component of hip hop music; the genre may also incorporate other elements of hip hop culture, including DJing, turntablism, and scratching, beatboxing, and instrumental tracks. Hip hop as music and culture formed during the 1970s when block parties became increasingly popular in New York City, particularly among African American youth residing in the Bronx. At block parties DJs played percussive breaks of popular songs using two turntables to extend the breaks.[clarification needed] Hip hop's early evolution occurred as sampling technology and drum-machines became widely available and affordable. Turntablist techniques developed along with the breaks and the Jamaican toasting vocal style was used. Rapping developed as a vocal style in which the artist speaks along with an instrumental or synthesized beat. Notable artists at this time include DJ Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five, Fab Five Freddy, Marley Marl, Afrika Bambaataa, Kool Moe Dee, Kurtis Blow, Doug E. Fresh, Whodini, Warp 9, the Fat Boys, and Spoonie Gee. The Sugarhill Gang's 1979 song \"Rapper's Delight\" is widely regarded to be the first hip hop record to gain widespread popularity in the mainstream. The 1980s marked the diversification of hip hop as the genre developed more complex styles. Prior to the 1980s, hip hop music was largely confined within the United States. However, during the 1980s, it began its spread and became a part of the music scene in dozens of countries. New school hip hop was the second wave of hip hop music, originating in 1983–84 with the early records of Run-D.M.C. and LL Cool J. The Golden age hip hop period was an innovative period between the mid-1980s and the early 1990s. Notable artists from this era include the Juice Crew, Public Enemy, Eric B. & Rakim, Boogie Down Productions and KRS-One, EPMD, Slick Rick, Beastie Boys, Kool G Rap, Big Daddy Kane, Ultramagnetic MCs, De La Soul, and A Tribe Called Quest. Gangsta rap is a subgenre of hip hop that often focuses on the violent lifestyles and impoverished conditions of inner-city youths. Schoolly D, N.W.A, Ice-T, Ice Cube, and the Geto Boys are artists most frequently associated with the founding of gangsta rap. These artists were known for mixing the political and social commentary of political rap with the criminal elements and crime stories found in gangsta rap. In the West Coast hip hop style, G-funk dominated mainstream hip hop for several years during the 1990s. East Coast hip hop in the early to mid 1990s was dominated by the Afrocentric jazz rap and alternative hip hop of the Native Tongues posse as well as the hardcore rap of artists such as Nas, Wu-Tang Clan, and Notorious B.I.G.. In the 1990s, hip hop began to diversify with other regional styles emerging on the national scene, such as Southern rap and Atlanta hip hop. At the same time, hip hop continued to be assimilated into other genres of popular music, an example being Neo soul. Hip hop became a best-selling music genre in the mid-1990s and the top selling music genre by 1999. The popularity of hip hop music continued through the 2000s, with hip hop influences also increasingly finding their way into mainstream pop. The United States also saw the success of styles such as crunk, a music that emphasized the beats and music more than the lyrics. Starting in 2005, sales of hip hop music in the United States began to severely wane. During the mid-2000s that alternative hip hop secured a place within the mainstream, due in part to the crossover success of artists such as OutKast and Kanye West.",

That city was, according to the legend, the capital of the kingdom of Cornouaille. The opera was premiered on 7 May 1888 by the Opéra Comique at the Théâtre Lyrique on the Place du Châtelet in Paris. Apart from the overture, the most famous piece in the opera is the tenor's aubade in act 3, \"Vainement, ma bien-aimée\" (\"In vain, my beloved\"). Lalo was known outside France primarily for other work, but within France he was recognized almost solely for this opera. His first version of the opera was widely rejected during the 1870s, but the revised work met with great success the following decade, becoming his most successful work for the stage."

      "description": "Texas country music (more popularly known just as Texas country or Texas music) is a rapidly growing subgenre of American country music. Texas country is known for fusing traditionalist root sounds (similar to neotraditional country) with the outspoken, care-free views of outlaw country. Texas country blends these subgenres by featuring straightforward, truthful lyrics, a \"take it or leave it\" approach, a \"common working man\" theme, comical, witty undertones, intense live performances, and loyal fan-bases. These often combine with stripped down music, increasing the intimate connection between a singer and audience. Texas Country Music can also be called, \"Red Dirt\" country music, which originated in Texas and Oklahoma. The two states, Texas and Oklahoma, have influenced the scene of this particular genre. Both states have fled the scene of recent main-stream country music, to create their own respective sound.[citation needed] Although it is often anti-Nashville, neither the location of birth nor the location of upbringing seems to calculate in the definition of a Texas country artist, as long as the origin is not in the corporate Nashville scene. Though many are Texas natives, many outside the state lines have tested the Texas waters. Artists such as Chris Knight are often considered Texas country musicians, despite his Kentucky ties. Adam Hood, an Alabama native, also has had success in the Texas country market. Perhaps the most distinguishing characteristic of a Texas Country artist is that they hold the majority of their concerts in Texas venues and their music is charted in one of the two Texas Music Charts as opposed to the Billboard chart. Even international musicians, such as Alberta, Canada native Corb Lund have been successful in the Red Dirt scene.",

      "description": "Dubstep /ˈdʌbstɛp/ is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in South London, England. It emerged in the late 1990s as a development within a lineage of related styles such as 2-step garage, broken beat, drum and bass, jungle, dub and reggae. In the UK the origins of the genre can be traced back to the growth of the Jamaican sound system party scene in the early 1980s. The music generally features syncopated drum and percussion patterns with bass lines that contain prominent sub bass frequencies. The earliest dubstep releases date back to 1998, and were usually featured as B-sides of 2-step garage single releases. These tracks were darker, more experimental remixes with less emphasis on vocals, and attempted to incorporate elements of breakbeat and drum and bass into 2-step. In 2001, this and other strains of dark garage music began to be showcased and promoted at London's night club Plastic People, at the \"Forward\" night (sometimes stylised as FWD>>), which went on to be considerably influential to the development of dubstep. The term \"dubstep\" in reference to a genre of music began to be used by around 2002 by labels such as Big Apple, Ammunition, and Tempa, by which time stylistic trends used in creating these remixes started to become more noticeable and distinct from 2-step and grime. A very early supporter of the sound was BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel, who started playing it from 2003 onwards. In 2004, the last year of his show, his listeners voted Distance, Digital Mystikz, and Plastician in their top 50 for the year. Dubstep started to spread beyond small local scenes in late 2005 and early 2006; many websites devoted to the genre appeared on the Internet and aided the growth of the scene, such as dubstepforum, the download site Barefiles and blogs such as gutterbreakz. Simultaneously, the genre was receiving extensive coverage in music magazines such as The Wire and online publications such as Pitchfork Media, with a regular feature entitled The Month In: Grime/Dubstep. Interest in dubstep grew significantly after BBC Radio 1 DJ Mary Anne Hobbs started championing the genre, beginning with a show devoted to it (entitled \"Dubstep Warz\") in January 2006. Towards the end of the 2000s and into the early 2010s, the genre started to become more commercially successful in the UK, with more singles and remixes entering the music charts. Music journalists and critics also noticed a dubstep influence in several pop artists' work. Around this time, producers also began to fuse elements of the original dubstep sound with other influences, creating fusion genres including future garage, the slower and more experimental post-dubstep, and the harsher electro house and heavy metal influenced brostep, the latter of which greatly contributed to dubstep's rising mainstream popularity in the United States.",

Although a house variant from Detroit, Gabber music reached Amsterdam in the late 1980s, it was the producers and DJs from Rotterdam in the early 90's who evolved it into a harder house variant which is today known as \"gabber\". The specific sound of Rotterdam was also created as a reaction to the house scene of Amsterdam which was seen as \"snobby and pretentious\". Though house tracks from Frankfurt's Marc Acardipane were quite similar to the Rotterdam style, it was the popularity of this music in the Netherlands which made Rotterdam the cradle of early hardcore. The essence of the early hardcore sound is a distorted bass drum sample, overdriven to the point where it becomes clipped into a distorted square wave and makes a recognizably melodic tone. Often the Roland Alpha Juno or the kick from a Roland TR-909 was used to create this sound. Early hardcore tracks typically include samples and synthesised melodies with the typical tempo ranging from 150 to 190 bpm. Violence, drugs and profanity are common themes in early hardcore, perceptible through its samples and lyrics, often screamed, pitch shifted or distorted. Early hardcore was popular in many countries, including the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, and Italy. In the late 1990s, the early hardcore became less popular than hardstyle. After surviving underground for a number of years, in 2002 the style reappeared in the Netherlands in a new form, the mainstream hardcore. The sound became more commercial, dark and industrial.",

      "description": "Art rock is a subgenre of rock music that originated in the 1960s with influences from art (avant-garde and classical) music. The first usage of the term, according to Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, was in 1968. Art rock was a form of music which wanted to \"extend the limits of rock & roll\", and opted for a more experimental and conceptual outlook on music. Art rock took influences from several genres, notably classical music, as well as experimental rock, psychedelia, avant garde, folk, baroque pop, and, in later compositions, jazz. Art rock has often been used synonymously with progressive rock; nevertheless, differences have been identified between the genres, with art rock emphasizing avant-garde or experimental influences and \"novel sonic structure,\" while progressive rock has been characterized as putting a greater emphasis on classically-trained instrumental technique, literary content, and symphonic features. Art rock, as a term, can also be used to refer to either classically driven rock, or a progressive rock-folk fusion, making it an eclectic genre. Common characteristics of art rock include album-oriented music divided into compositions rather than songs, with usually complicated and long instrumental sections, symphonic orchestration, and an experimental style. Art rock music was traditionally used within the context of concept records, and its lyrical themes tended to be \"imaginative\", philosophical, and politically oriented. While art rock developed towards the end of the 1960s, it enjoyed its greatest level of popularity in the early 1970s through British artists such as Pink Floyd, Roxy Music, David Bowie, Jethro Tull, Electric Light Orchestra, 10cc, the Moody Blues, Emerson, Lake and Palmer and Procol Harum. Several other experimental rock artists of the time were also characterized as art rock, including Brian Eno and the American artists the Velvet Underground, Laurie Anderson and Frank Zappa. Art rock's success continued to the 1990s. Several pop and rock exponents of the period, including Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush, incorporated elements of art rock within their work. Art rock, as well as the theatrical nature of performances associated with the genre, was able to appeal to \"artistically inclined\" adolescents and younger adults, especially due to its \"virtuosity\" and musical \"complexity\".",

      "description": "Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from a combination of African-American genres such as blues, boogie woogie, jump blues, jazz, and gospel music, together with Western swing and country music. Though elements of rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until the 1950s. \"Rock and roll\" can refer either to the first wave of music that originated in the US in the 1950s prior to its development into \"rock music\", or more broadly to rock music and culture. For the purpose of differentiation, this article deals with the first definition. In the earliest rock and roll styles of the late 1940s and early 1950s, either the piano or saxophone was often the lead instrument, but these were generally replaced or supplemented by guitar in the middle to late 1950s. The beat is essentially a blues rhythm with an accentuated backbeat, the latter almost always provided by a snare drum. Classic rock and roll is usually played with one or two electric guitars (one lead, one rhythm), a string bass or (after the mid-1950s) an electric bass guitar, and a drum kit. Beyond simply a musical style, rock and roll, as seen in movies and on television, influenced lifestyles, fashion, attitudes, and language. In addition, rock and roll may have contributed to the civil rights movement because both African-American and white American teens enjoyed the music. It went on to spawn various genres, often without the initially characteristic backbeat, that are now more commonly called simply \"rock music\" or \"rock\".",

      "description": "Noise rock is a style of rock music that became prominent in the 1980s. Noise rock makes use of the traditional instrumentation and iconography of rock, but incorporates atonality and especially dissonance, and frequently discards typical songwriting conventions. Noise rock developed from early avant-garde music, sound art, and rock songs featuring extremely dissonant sounds and electronic feedback. The New York no wave scene, featuring such artists as Mars and Teenage Jesus and the Jerks in the late 1970s, was an essential development in noise rock. A number of noise rock bands emerged in North America in the 1980s. These included Caroliner, and Grotus (San Francisco), Big Black (Chicago), Butthole Surfers, The Jesus Lizard, Scratch Acid (Texas), The Melvins (Montesano, Washington), Dinosaur Jr. (Massachusetts), Sonic Youth, Live Skull, Swans, White Zombie, The Thing, Blow 454 and Helmet (New York), Pussy Galore and Royal Trux (Washington DC), among many others. A similar scene also began to develop in Osaka, Japan, spearheaded by Hanatarash and the Boredoms, The British shoegazing groups developed an entirely distinct form of noise rock, largely derived from the so-called noise pop related genre. Some math rock groups like Don Caballero are also considered noise rock. The '80s noise rock bands were significant influences on Nirvana and Hole, The powerviolence scene was close to noise rock, with Man Is the Bastard eventually dissolving into unstructured noise music. Beginning in the mid-90s, Providence became the center of a new crop of noise-rock bands, largely a product of the RISD scene. After 2000, noise rock groups formed all over the world. Post 2000 noise rock often features tribal polyrhythmic drum patterns. Noise rock groups that formed after 2010 include Roomrunner, Dope Body, Nü Sensae, METZ, Disappears, Dumb Numbers, as well as new Japanese acts such as Nisennenmondai.",

Long pitch-shifted snare rolls are common in oldschool jungle. The terms \"jungle\" and \"drum and bass\" are often used interchangeably, although whether the two genres are actually distinct is an ongoing topic of debate. For those individuals who consider the two genres as separate entities, drum and bass is usually considered to have departed from jungle in the mid to late 1990s. Producers create the drum patterns, which are sometimes completely off-beat, by cutting apart breakbeats (most notably the Amen break). Jungle producers incorporated classic Jamaican/Caribbean sound-system culture production-methods. The slow, deep basslines and simple melodies (reminiscent of those found in dub, reggae and dancehall) accentuated the overall production, giving jungle its \"rolling\" quality.",

      "description": "Northern soul is a music and dance movement that emerged independently in Northern England, the English Midlands, Scotland and Wales in the late 1960s from the British mod scene. Northern soul mainly consists of a particular style of black American soul music based on the heavy beat and fast tempo of the mid-1960s Tamla Motown sound. The northern soul movement, however, generally eschews Motown or Motown-influenced music that has had significant mainstream commercial success. The recordings most prized by enthusiasts of the genre are usually by lesser-known artists, released only in limited numbers, often by small regional American labels such as Ric-Tic and Golden World Records (Detroit), Mirwood (Los Angeles) and Shout and Okeh (New York/Chicago). Northern soul is associated with particular dance styles and fashions that grew out of the underground rhythm & soul scene of the late 1960s at venues such as the Twisted Wheel in Manchester. This scene and the associated dances and fashions quickly spread to other UK dancehalls and nightclubs like the Chateau Impney (Droitwich), Catacombs (Wolverhampton), the Highland Rooms at Blackpool Mecca, Golden Torch (Stoke-on-Trent) and Wigan Casino. As the favoured beat became more uptempo and frantic, by the early 1970s, northern soul dancing became more athletic, somewhat resembling the later dance styles of disco and break dancing. Featuring spins, flips, karate kicks and backdrops, club dancing styles were often inspired by the stage performances of touring American soul acts such as Little Anthony & The Imperials and Jackie Wilson. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, popular northern soul records generally dated from the mid-1960s. This meant that the movement was sustained (and \"new\" recordings added to playlists) by prominent DJs discovering rare and previously overlooked records. Later on, certain clubs and DJs began to move away from the 1960s Motown sound and began to play newer releases with a more contemporary sound.",

In 1940, it was included in the Episcopal Church hymnal, making it the first spiritual to be included in any major American hymnal. As reported in Howard Thurman's autobiography, the song was one of Mahatma Gandhi's favorites. The song has been recorded by artists including Marion Williams, Johnny Cash, Phil Keaggy, Max Roach, Diamanda Galás, Harry Belafonte, The Seldom Scene, Diamond Version (with Neil Tennant), and Bayard Rustin."

As opposed to contemporary pop music singers who may write or co-write their own songs,[citation needed] the term singer-songwriter describes a distinct form of artistry, closely associated with the folk-acoustic tradition. Singer-songwriters often provide the sole accompaniment to an entire composition or song, typically using a guitar or piano; both the compositions and the arrangements are written primarily as solo vehicles, with the material angled toward topical issues—sometimes political, sometimes introspective, sensitive, romantic, and confessional. Often, the songs written by these musicians serve not only as entertainment, but also as tools for political protest, as in the cases of the Almanac Singers, Pete Seeger and Woody Guthrie, whose guitar was inscribed with the words, \"This machine kills fascists\"."

      "description": "Instrumental rock is a type of rock music which emphasizes musical instruments, and which features very little or no singing. Examples of instrumental rock can be found in practically every subgenre of rock, often from musicians who specialize in the style. Instrumental rock was most popular from the mid-1950s to mid-1960s, with artists such as Bill Doggett Combo, Jimmy Reed, Earl Bostic, The Fireballs, The Shadows, and The Ventures. Surf music had many instrumental songs. Many instrumental hits came from the R&B world. Funk and disco produced several instrumental hit singles during the 1970s. The Allman Brothers Band have many instrumentals. Jeff Beck also recorded two instrumental albums in the '70s. Progressive rock and art rock performers of the 1960s and 1970s did many virtuosic instrumental performances. During the 1980s and 90s, the instrumental rock genre was dominated by several guitar soloists, including Joe Satriani, Marty Friedman and Steve Vai. The 2000s gave way for a new style of instrumental performer. For example, John Lowery (a.k.a. John 5), released a solo instrumental album. The 2000s also saw the rise of instrumental music by bands that have been labeled post-rock.",

      "description": "Traditional bluegrass, as the name implies, emphasizes the traditional elements of bluegrass music, and stands in contrast to progressive bluegrass. Traditional bluegrass musicians play folk songs, tunes with simple traditional chord progressions, and on acoustic instruments of a type that were played by bluegrass pioneer Bill Monroe and his Blue Grass Boys band in the late 1940s. Traditional bands may use their instruments in slightly different ways, for example by using multiple guitars or fiddles in a band. In some traditional bluegrass bands, the guitar rarely takes the lead, instead acting as a rhythm instrument, one notable exception being gospel-based songs. Melodies and lyrics tend to be simple, often in the key of G, and a I-IV-V chord pattern is common. Although traditional bluegrass performers do not use electrically amplified instruments, as used in other forms of popular music, it is common practice to \"mike\" acoustic instruments during stage performances before larger audiences. Bill Monroe's mandolin playing style and Kenny Baker's fiddling set the standard for traditional bluegrass musicians on those instruments. Earl Scruggs is recognized as the developer of bluegrass three finger style banjo playing. There are ideological divisions even among traditional bluegrass bands. These divisions center on the longstanding debate about what constitutes \"Bluegrass Music.\" A few traditional bluegrass musicians don't consider progressive bluegrass to truly be \"bluegrass,\" some going so far as to suggest bluegrass must be styled directly after Bill Monroe's bands. However, stylistic divergences in traditional bluegrass generally center around which first generation bands from which contemporary musicians have drawn inspiration. Examples include bands who sing in the Stanley Brothers tradition: Roy Lee Centers, Larry Sparks, Sammy Adkins, The Fields Bros, The Wilson Brothers, The Gillis Brothers and various local bands across the country. Other bands followed Lester Flatt, such as Willis Spears, Curley Seckler and Karl Shifflett. Mac Wiseman's \"crooning\" style of Bluegrass engendered Hylo Brown and Sid Campbell. The Osborne Brothers have followers in Larry Stephenson as well as the Grascals. Frank Necessary, Blue Maggie and Hud Hadley were strongly influenced by Jimmy Martin.",

      "description": "The musicianship of Brian Wilson, co-founder and multi-tasking leader of the Beach Boys, is widely considered one of the most innovative and significant of the late 20th century, and his work is credited as a major innovation in the field of music production. Through his band, \"[Brian] pretty much single-handedly raised the craft of pop songwriting from the awkwardly sub-lunar to the gracefully sublime,\" writes Jeff Miers of The Buffalo News, while Adam Webb of The Guardian wrote: \"Brian proved pop music could be high art with limitless imagination.\" In a 1966 article that asks \"Do the Beach Boys rely too much on sound genius Brian?\" brother and bandmate Carl Wilson responded that every member of the group contributes ideas, but admitted that Brian was majorly responsible for their music. Dennis Wilson is quoted: \"Brian Wilson is the Beach Boys. He is the band. We're his fucking messengers. He is all of it. Period. We're nothing. He's everything.\" Only 21 years old when he received the freedom to produce his own records with total creative autonomy, he ignited an explosion of like-minded California producers, supplanting New York as the center of popular records, and becoming the first rock producer to use the studio as a discrete instrument. He used recording sessions as fertile creative terrain in and of themselves, a practice which was unheard of in his time and later shorthanded as \"playing the studio\". The positive commercial response to Brian's structurally irregular and harmonically varied pop compositions gave him the prestige, resources, and courage to further his creative aspirations. He proceeded to explore many unusual combinations of instruments while emphasizing inventive percussion and progressively ambitious lyricism. Using major Hollywood recording studios, Wilson arranged many of his compositions for a conglomerate of session musicians informally known as the Wrecking Crew. Their assistance was needed because of the increasingly complicated nature of his music. They were reportedly \"in awe of Brian\". Once he started incorporating quasi-symphonic textures into his work, many people began crediting him for propelling the mid-1960s art pop movement. With regards to Brian's mid 1960s productions, ethnomusicologist David Toop characterized his style as, \"cartoon music and Disney influence mutating into avant-garde pop\", a designation also lent by The New York Times. Sean O'Hagan of the High Llamas named him an important pioneer of experimental pop.",

In its original incarnation, it was often characterized by piano riffs, synthetic stabs and spacey effects. This genre of music is closely related to the typically Dutch genre of gabber. Happy hardcore evolved from breakbeat hardcore around 1991–1993, as the original house music-based rave became faster and began to include breakbeats, evolving into oldschool jungle which evolved into drum and bass.

However it was not until 1979, when Jamaican singer Bob Marley visited Japan on holiday that reggae would gain momentum. Marley wanted to attend a concert by the Flower Travellin Band and when looking for information, he met famed Japanese percussionist \"Pecker\" who informed him that the group had already disbanded. The two became good friends, and Pecker suggested to Marley a collaboration between acclaimed Japanese and Jamaican artists. This suggestion resulted in the albums Pecker Power, and Instant Rasta being recorded in Jamaica at \"Channel One\" and \"Tuff Gong Studio\" in 1980. The albums featured Japanese artists Minako Yoshida (吉田美奈子), Ryuuichi Sakamoto (坂本龍一), Naoya Matsuoka (松岡直也), Shigeharu Mukai (向井滋春), and Akira Sakata (坂田明), alongside Jamaican artists Augustus Pablo, Sly & Robbie, The Wailers, Rico Rodriguez, Carlton Barrett and Marcia Griffiths. These two albums influenced both Japanese and Jamaican artists, and are regarded as spreading reggae to Japan. Some of the first reggae artists from Japan were Joe Yamanaka and Mute Beat, the latter's recordings made Japan internationally renowned for dub and influenced many artists such as Dry & Heavy, Fishmans, UA. Another pioneering artist was Nahki. He was scouted by Sugar Minott and began performing in Jamaica, and later formed Japan's first reggae festival \"Japansplash\" in 1985. The esteemed band Jagatara (じゃがたら) combined punk rock, jazz, and funk with reggae and influenced hybrid artists such as Ego-Wrappin'. The dancehall style was brought to Japan by Rankin' Taxi in the mid 1980s, and rock group The Roosters incorporated ska into some of their songs which influenced artists such as the Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra, and Kemuri. Musical relations between Jamaican and Japanese artists continues to remain strong, often with collaborations between artists. The most important reggae festival is the Yokohama reggae festival or Yokohama Reggae Sai, which is usually in July to September, and has been moved to nearby Kawasaki.",

In the early 17th Century the main vernacular forms for Spanish and Portuguese composers were the villancico, usually a Christmas song, and the solo tono; tono humano if secular, tono divino if sacred. The cantata form had not yet been introduced from Italy. At this point tonos were generally strophic songs (coplas) with a refrain (estribillo). However by the end of the 17th century some tonos had begun to include recitative and aria sections, as the cantada, Spanish form of the cantata became known around 1700. The tono humano and tono divino could also have 2, 3 or 4 voices. Nearly all tonos humanos and semi-sacred villancicos were preserved only in manuscript. The best copies were in the Royal Palace in Madrid and in the nearby Buen Retiro, both of which were lost in fires. This, and the fall from fashion of the tono and villancico in the Iberian Peninsula, means that sources in Latin America are relatively important to recovery of this part of Iberian musical heritage. The Libro de tonos humanos Madrid 1656 (Biblioteca Nacional, M-1262) is the most substantial Iberian cancionero of the 17th Century with over 200 songs, almost all romances with estribillo in 4 voices. Additional surviving sources include the Mackworth manuscript. The tono was used both in theatre music, domestic music and church music. Composers active in the composition of tonos humanos include: In the New World the tono was taken up by:"

In 2006, the News Record used the term to refer to Arab Strap, describing their sound as \"a lot like the band's native Scotland: dark, cold, rainy and depressing\" as well as \"aggressive and somber.\" The term is still current in pop culture.

Yap in 2002 and was first applied to Missing Filemon's first album. Earning wide reception among the young in the Visayas and Mindanao, Bisrock is a fairly recent cultural phenomenon. The style started around the 1980s, when Cebu's rock scene was beginning to be labeled as \"Bisrock\". During this time, a group of musicians from the University of San Carlos coined the local music scene as Bisrock in support of patriotism for the Cebuano music scene. However, this genre is debatable as Bisrock seems to be popular only in Cebu. As it is, the movement died down around 2009, as even Missing Filemon themselves distanced itself from the term \"Bisrock\".",

The work is orchestrated for solo piano, flute, two oboes, two bassoons, two horns, and strings. As is typical with concertos, it is in three movements: According to the date that the composer himself noted on the score, the concerto was completed on April 12, 1784. The date of the premiere is uncertain. In one view, the work is said to have been premiered by Mozart's student Barbara Ployer on June 13, 1784, at a concert to which Mozart had invited Giovanni Paisiello to hear both her and his new compositions, including also his recently written Quintet in E flat for Piano and Winds. Afterwards, Ployer was joined by Mozart in a performance of the Sonata for Two Pianos, K. 448. Another possibility, advanced by Lorenz (2006, 314), is that Mozart did not wait over two months to premiere the work, but performed it in his concert with Regina Strinasacchi on 29 April 1784 at the Kärntnertortheater. As a general consensus for researchers, it can be said with relative certainty that the work premiered during the mid-to-late spring of 1784, following its completion. The finale is a variation movement whose theme was sung by Mozart's starling."

      "description": "Ghettotech (also known as Detroit club music) is a genre of electronic music originating from Detroit. It combines elements of Chicago's ghetto house with electro, Detroit techno, Miami bass and UK garage. It features four-on-the-floor rhythms and is usually faster than most other dance music genres, at roughly 145 to 160 BPM. As with ghetto house, vocals are often repititive and sometimes pornographic. As DJ Godfather puts it, \"the beats are really gritty, really raw, nothing polished.\" Ghettotech was born as a DJing style, inspired by the eclecticism of The Electrifying Mojo and the fast-paced mixing and turntablism of The Wizard, with DJs mixing genres including jungle, ghetto house, hip hop, R&B, electro and Detroit techno. The general BPM of the music's mixing style increases over time. A Detroit ghettotech style of dancing is called the jit. This dance style relies heavily on fast footwork combinations, drops, spins and improvisations. The roots of jit date back to Detroit Jitterbugs in the 1970s. Chicago's equivalent dance style is Juke, where the focus is on footwork dating back to the late 1980s. Ghettotech was an integral part of the Detroit Electronic Music Festival, an annual event. Ghettotech saw a decline around 2007 as some key artists distanced themselves from the genre. In recent years however the surge in popularity of Ghettotech's sister genre Chicago footwork, has help to spawn a new listener base. Ghettotech's newest wave of producers often produce tracks at 160 BPM to better accommodate mixing with Chicago footwork and other genres. Key record labels: Twiilight 76, Databass, Electrofunk, Jefferson Ave, Motor City Electro Company, Philthtrax, Intuit-Solar.",

In this version, Dandy Dick performs in a circus and loves the owners' daughter. The circus goes to Siam, where Dick unexpectedly receives a high office and marries his sweetheart. The opera premiered at the Avenue Theatre in London on 2 March 1895 and closed on 13 July 1895. It starred May Yohé as Dick Whittington, Ethel Haydon as Alice, and Henry Wright as Larry O'Brannagan. The conductor was Landon Ronald. The show was written as a vehicle for Yohé, who had starred in Little Christopher Columbus by the same authors, and producer William Greet leased the theatre especially for Dandy Dick Whittington. The piece was originally written as a pantomime but was later changed to an opéra bouffe (or comic opera). Unlike in the Dick Whittington legend, there are no rats in the piece. Audiences particularly enjoyed the \"acrobatic dance\" of Florence Levey with Henry Wright. The critic of The Sketch thought Wright's impersonation of the popular actor and comedian of the day, E. J. Lonnen, was as good as the original. Betraying its early roots as a pantomime, John F. Sheridan played the dame, Lady Fitzwarren."

Arthur Sullivan also did a setting, Lux in Tenebris, which Ian Bradley praises as a \"much more sensitive and honest setting of Newman's ambiguity and expressons of doubt\" than Dykes' \"steady, reassuring\" rhythms.

It is described by AllMusic as \"extremely fast, abrasive, and technically demanding\" music. \"It is usually considered less abrasive and more melodic than thrash metal, showing less influence from hardcore punk. However, speed metal is usually faster and more aggressive than traditional heavy metal, also showing more inclination to virtuoso soloing and featuring short instrumental passages between couplets. Speed metal songs frequently make use of highly expressive vocals, but are usually less likely to employ 'harsh' vocals than thrash metal songs.\" The concept of speed metal had changed through the years. Speed metal is generally not considered to be stylistically between heavy metal and thrash metal, but rather in terms of song structure. It is not only a matter of tempo as many speed metal bands play 'faster' than thrash metal bands. For example, Metallica and Anthrax are commonly labelled as thrash metal bands, however are stylistically similar to speed metal bands. The difference between speed and thrash metal can be observed between Metallica's faster songs and 'Darkness Descends' by Dark Angel, which exhibits more thrash metal-like style.",

      "description": "Drum and bass (/ˈdrʌm ənd ˈbeɪs/) (also written as drum 'n' bass and commonly abbreviated as D&B, DnB or D'n'B) is a genre of electronic music which emerged from rave and oldschool jungle scenes in England during the early 1990s. The style is often characterized by fast breakbeats (typically between 150–180 beats per minute) with heavy bass and sub-bass lines, sampled sources, and synthesizers. The popularity of drum and bass at its commercial peak ran parallel to several other homegrown dance styles in the UK including big beat and hard house. Drum n bass incorporates a number of scenes and styles. A major influence on jungle and drum and bass was the original Jamaican dub and reggae sound. Another feature of the style is the complex syncopation of the drum tracks' breakbeat. Drum and bass subgenres include breakcore, ragga jungle, hardstep, darkstep, techstep, Neurofunk, ambient drum and bass, liquid funk, deep, drumfunk, funkstep, sambass dnbnoise and drill 'n' bass. From its roots in the UK, the style has established itself around the world. Drum and bass has influenced many other genres like hip hop, big beat, dubstep, house music, trip hop, ambient music, techno, rock and pop. Drum and bass is dominated by a small group of record labels. The major international music labels have shown very little interest in the drum and bass scene. Drum and Bass remains most popular in the UK, but has developed scenes all around the world, in countries such as the Netherlands, Belgium, New Zealand, Canada and Australia.",

      "description": "Hard bop is a subgenre of jazz that is an extension of bebop (or \"bop\") music. Journalists and record companies began using the term in the mid-1950s to describe a new current within jazz which incorporated influences from rhythm and blues, gospel music, and blues, especially in saxophone and piano playing. David H. Rosenthal contends in his book Hard Bop that the genre is, to a large degree, the natural creation of a generation of African-American musicians who grew up at a time when bop and rhythm and blues were the dominant forms of black American music.:24 Prominent hard bop musicians included Horace Silver, Charles Mingus, Art Blakey, Cannonball Adderley, Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk and Tadd Dameron. Hard bop is sometimes referred to as \"funky hard bop.\" The \"funky\" label refers to the rollicking, rhythmic feeling associated with the style. The descriptor is also used to describe soul jazz, which is commonly associated with hard bop. According to Mark C. Gridley, soul jazz more specifically refers to music with \"an earthy, bluesy melodic concept and... repetitive, dance-like rhythms.... Note that some listeners make no distinction between 'soul-jazz' and 'funky hard bop,' and many musicians don't consider 'soul-jazz' to be continuous with 'hard bop.'\" The term \"soul\" suggests the church, and traditional gospel music elements such as \"amen chords\" (the plagal cadence) and triadic harmonies seemed to suddenly appear in jazz during the era.",

      "description": "Grindcore is an extreme genre of music that originated in the early to mid-1980s. It draws inspiration from some of the most abrasive-sounding popular music genres – including hardcore punk, thrash metal, crust punk, industrial and noise rock. Grindcore is characterized by a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups like Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor. A trait of grindcore is the \"microsong\". Several bands have produced songs that are only seconds in length. British band Napalm Death holds the Guinness World Record for shortest song ever recorded with the one-second \"You Suffer\" (1987). Many bands, such as Agoraphobic Nosebleed, record simple phrases that may be rhythmically sprawled out across an instrumental lasting only a couple of bars in length. A variety of \"microgenres\" have subsequently emerged, often labeling bands according to traits that deviate from regular grindcore, including goregrind, focused on themes of gore, and pornogrind, fixated on pornographic lyrical themes. Other offshoots include noisegrind (especially raw and chaotic) and cybergrind (incorporating electronic elements such as sampling and programmed drums). Although an influential phenomenon on hardcore punk and other popular genres, grindcore itself remains an underground form of music.",

      "description": "Dancehall is a genre of Jamaican popular music that originated in the late 1970s. Initially dancehall was a more sparse version of reggae than the roots style, which had dominated much of the 1970s. Two of the biggest stars of the early dancehall era were Yellowman and Eek-a-Mouse. Dancehall brought a new generation of producers, including Linval Thompson, Gussie Clarke and Jah Thomas. In the mid-1980s, digital instrumentation became more prevalent, changing the sound considerably, with digital dancehall (or \"ragga\") becoming increasingly characterized by faster rhythms. (The word \"bashment\", a term originating in the 1990s, was used to describe a particularly good dance; for example \"to go to a bashment dance\". In the Dancehall vernacular, \"bashment\" is therefore an adjective instead of a noun.) In the early 1990s songs by Dawn Penn, Shabba Ranks, Patra and Chaka Demus and Pliers were the first dancehall megahits in the US and abroad. Other varieties of dancehall achieved crossover success outside of Jamaica during the mid-to-late 1990s. After the popularizing of Buju Banton's dancehall song \"Boom Bye Bye\" in the early 1990s, dancehall music came under criticism over anti-gay lyrics in a few songs. The early 2000s saw the success of newer charting acts such as Rihanna, Elephant Man and Sean Paul. Dancehall made a resurgence within the pop market in the late 2000s, with songs by Konshens, Mr. Vegas, Popcaan, Mavado, Vybz Kartel, Beenie Man among others.",

The terms jazz band, jazz ensemble, stage band, jazz orchestra, and dance band are also used to refer to this type of ensemble. This does not, however, mean that each one of these names is technically correct for naming a 'big band\" specifically. In contrast to smaller jazz combos, in which most of the music is improvised, or created spontaneously, music played by big bands is highly \"arranged\", or prepared in advance and notated on sheet music. The music is traditionally called 'charts'. Improvised solos may be played only when called for by the arranger.",

The earliest bands to be described as \"art-punk\" were bands from the New York scene of the mid-1970s such as the New York Dolls, Television, Patti Smith, Devo, and Talking Heads in their early years. Bands such as Wire (most of whom had been art students), and The Ex, who have incorporated jazz, noise and ethnic music into their punk rock sound, took elements from the avant-garde and were described as \"avant-punk\". Later bands such as Dog Faced Hermans followed a similar path. The no wave scene of the late 1970s and early 1980s is seen as a branch of art punk, and was described by Martin Rev of Suicide as \"a valid avant-garde extension of rock\". Other bands described as \"art punk\" include Fugazi, and Goes Cube. Crass have also been described as art punk due to their incorporation of other art forms into their performances. In their book Art into Pop, Simon Frith and Howard Horne described the band managers of the 1970s punk bands as \"the most articulate theorists of the art punk movement\", with Bob Last of Fast Product identified as one of the first to apply art theory to marketing, and Tony Wilson's Factory Records described as \"applying the Bauhaus principle of the same 'look' for all the company's goods\". Anna Szemere traces the beginnings of the Hungarian art-punk subculture to 1978, when punk band The Spions performed three concerts which drew on conceptualist performance art and Antonin Artaud's \"theatre of cruelty\", with neo-avant-garde/anarchist manifestos handed out to the audience. Wire's Colin Newman described art punk in 2006 as \"the drug of choice of a whole generation.\"",

Primarily popular and active in the 1980s and 1990s but still alive today, the Japanoise scene is defined by a remarkable sense of musical freedom. Some of the most popular groups range from the high-energy free improv stylings of Hijokaidan, the punk demolition of Hanatarash and its subsequent psychedelic Boredoms evolutions, to the tabletop electronics of Incapacitants and Merzbow. Aside from artists often releasing tapes and records in extremely limited quantities, countless side-projects, and collaborations exist within and outside the scene, making the pursuit of Japanoise media an intimidating quest for collectors. Japanoise, and particularly harsh noise, as opposed to some other post-industrial related styles, is often much less aggressively \"serious\" image-based, being focused more on the sole act of \"jamming\" as hard, loud or ridiculously as possible. Nick Cain of The Wire identifies the \"primacy of Japanese Noise artists like Merzbow, Hijokaidan and Incapacitants\" as one of the major developments in noise music since 1990. Certain Japanese noise artists themselves feel uncomfortable being categorized under the umbrella of \"Japanese noise\", arguing that use of the term is a way of ignoring the differences between musicians who don't necessarily follow the same approach or even know each other at all.",

      "description": "Balkan brass, known as Serbian: Труба, \"trumpet\", is a distinctive style of music originating in 19th century Serbia when trumpeters in the military transcribed folk music during harsh times. It is popular throughout the Balkans, especially Serbia, Macedonia and Bulgaria. The beats are usually fast and often accompanied by kolo, a dance. The performers each have their instrument of the orchestra and are called trubači (трубачи). Some of the best known examples of acclaimed music in this style are from Goran Bregović and Boban Marković Orkestar. The Serbian film maker Emir Kusturica has, through his films (Black Cat, White Cat), made the style popular in the international community outside the Balkans. The biggest brass band event in the world the Guča Trumpet Festival is a 5-day annual festival with 300,000 visitors, in Guča, Serbia.",

Its melodramatic story is set in Muscovadia, a mythical country in the Balkans, and involves an impoverished nobleman turned bandit, his daughter Carmelita, and her lover Stephen, a captain in the hussars. The action unfolds over a single night at the end of which both lovers are dead—Stephen stabbed to death by Carmelita and Carmelita shot by Stephen's fellow hussars. The only one of Breil's six operas to be performed by a major opera company, The Legend received scathing press reviews and after its three performances at the Met disappeared from the repertory."

Traditional/classic pop music is generally regarded as having existed between the mid-1940s and mid-1950s. AllMusic defines traditional pop as \"post-big band and pre-rock & roll pop music.\" This definition is disputed by many scholars, however, as many of the most popular works of Cole Porter and those of George and Ira Gershwin pre-date World War II, while the works of Irving Berlin and Jerome Kern date to World War I. The most popular and enduring songs from this style of music are known as pop standards or (where relevant) American standards. More generally, the term \"standard\" can be applied to any popular song that has become very widely known within mainstream culture. The works of these songwriters and composers are usually considered part of the canon known as the \"Great American Songbook\".",

Christian hip hop emerged from urban communities in the United States in the 1980s, when it existed almost exclusively in small underground scenes, with minimal formal industry promotion and little mainstream attention. Christian hip hop, blending rhythmic music and faith-based lyrics, first emerged on record in 1982 with a track entitled \"Jesus Christ (The Gospel Beat)\" by Queens, New York artist McSweet. The first full-length, Christian hip hop album, Bible Break, by Oklahoma artist Stephen Wiley, was released in 1985 with the title track becoming a hit on Christian radio in 1986. Other early Christian hip recording artists from the mid-1980s included P.I.D. (Preachas in Disguise), who recorded to funky rock rhythms, as well as JC & the Boys and Michael Peace. The most prominent Christian rappers have been tobyMac, who was the first rapper to have success in the mainstream Christian music scene, and Lecrae, who has emerged recently on the mainstream rap scene. Christian rap has almost exclusively come out Protestant traditions in the United States, although there is a small Catholic Rap scene that has recently emerged, and there are also small Christian rap scenes in the UK, Australia, Brazil, Canada and many other countries where Christians reside and hip hop music is popular.",

      "description": "Mit Fried und Freud ich fahr dahin (With peace and joy I depart), BWV 125, is a church cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach. He composed the chorale cantata in Leipzig in 1725 for the Feast of the purification of Mary and first performed it on 2 February 1725. The text is based on the hymn \"Mit Fried und Freud ich fahr dahin\" in four stanzas by Martin Luther, published in 1524. The gospel for the feast day, the presentation of Jesus at the Temple, includes Simeon's canticle Nunc dimittis, which Luther paraphrased in his hymn. An unknown librettist retained the first and the last of Luther's four stanzas. He paraphrased the second stanza in an aria, then juxtaposed it, quoting it completely, by recitative, and derived two more movements from the third stanza. Bach structured the cantata in six movements, framing four movements for soloists by a chorale fantasia and a closing chorale. He scored it for three vocal soloists, a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of a horn to support the chorale tune, flauto traverso, oboe, oboe d'amore, strings and basso continuo. The opening chorus, a chorale fantasia on the hymn tune in Phrygian mode has been compared to the opening movement of Bach's St Matthew Passion: \"death, sleep, a journey of departure, peace and consolation are some of the intertwined themes and images.\""

Sometimes the beats are more complicated and more foregrounded instead of being in the background, but even then they are usually less intense than other kinds of electronic music like trance and house. The tempo is often slower than that of traditional electronic dance music. Often the names \"chill-out music\" or \"chill-out\" are used to refer to songs demonstrative of the genre, but those names also refer to other styles of music, and downtempo encompasses a wider variety of styles than those terms alone would indicate. Due to the relaxing and often sensual or romantic feel of most downtempo music, it is a popular form of background music in 'chill out rooms' of dance parties, and many alternative cafes.",

Baroque pop's mainstream popularity faded by the 1970s, partially because punk rock, disco and hard rock took over; nonetheless, music was still produced within the genre's tradition, and it exerted an influence on subsequent movements such as Philadelphia soul in the 1970s and chamber pop in the 1990s, which both incorporated the spirit of baroque pop while the latter contested much of the time's low fidelity musical aesthetic. Since the 1990s, baroque pop has seen a revival; several prominent artists, such as Belle and Sebastian, Regina Spektor and the Divine Comedy, have performed or incorporated elements of the genre in their work.[not verified in body]",

      "description": "Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid- to late 1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and rhythm and blues (R&B). Funk de-emphasizes melody and harmony and brings a strong rhythmic groove of electric bass and drums to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths. Like much African-inspired music, funk typically consists of a complex groove with rhythm instruments such as electric guitar, electric bass, Hammond organ, and drums playing interlocking rhythms. Funk bands sometimes have a horn section of several saxophones, trumpets, and in some cases, a trombone, which plays rhythmic \"hits\". Funk originated in the mid-1960s, with James Brown's development of a signature groove that emphasized the downbeat—with heavy emphasis on the first beat of every measure, funky bass lines, drum patterns, and syncopated guitar riffs. Other musical groups, including Sly & the Family Stone and Parliament-Funkadelic, soon began to adopt and develop Brown's innovations. While much of the written history of funk focuses on men, there have been notable funk women, including Chaka Khan, Labelle, Brides of Funkenstein, Klymaxx, Mother's Finest, and Betty Davis. Many of the most famous bands in the genre also played disco and soul extensively. Funk derivatives include funk rock (e.g., Red Hot Chili Peppers); boogie (or electro-funk), an electronic music; electro music, a hybrid of electronic music and funk; funk metal (e.g., Living Colour); G-funk, a mix of gangsta rap and funk; Timba, a form of funky Cuban popular dance music; and funk jam (e.g., Phish). Funk samples have been used extensively in genres including hip hop, house music, and drum and bass. It is also the main influence of go-go, a subgenre associated with funk.",

The symphony was premiered on 28 November 1940 by Nikolai Golovanov conducting the Large All-Union Radio SO. It has three movements: The first movement is in sonata form. The Adagio is on two themes, in C and in A♭, which appear contrapuntally at the reappearance of the first; it has the form A-B (l'Istesso tempo, Andantino)-A'-B'-coda. The finale is a rondo whose E major concluding pages incorporate a climactic reappearance by the main theme of the Adagio, leading Richard Taruskin to remark of this symphony that it is Myaskovsky's \"Land of Hope and Glory\"."

More recently, scholars have included British rock music from the 1960s and 1970s that utilizes South Asian musical materials and instruments and Western ideas of South Asia. Raga rock is not normally considered a specific genre of music, but rather a general aspect of any rock significantly influenced by Indian classical music. Since Indian influences are primarily limited to 1960s rock, most raga rock is limited to that decade, although heavily Indian-derived sounds are found in some post-1960s rock.",

      "description": "Cristoforo Colombo (Christopher Columbus, [kriˈstɔːforo koˈlombo]) is an opera in four acts and an epilogue by Alberto Franchetti to an Italian libretto by Luigi Illica. It was written in 1892 to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus' arrival in America. Commissioned by the city of Genoa, Columbus' birthplace, the opera deals with the voyage of discovery, its opposition by the Spanish authorities, Columbus' encouragement by Queen Isabella, and finally, after his difficulties and triumph, his anguish when he learns of her death. An essentially melodic opera only tangentially influenced by the emerging verismo style, it is harmonically rich, with obvious references to the work of Richard Wagner and Meyerbeer. The Act 2 monologue contains a Rhine-like motif; after cries of Terra! Terra! the orchestra replies with Tristan-like ecstasy, and then a rainbow bridge-like triumph. Its anti-church elements have been noted, particularly in the opera's earlier versions: it is the clerics who oppose the voyage initially, and who violently attempt to evangelise the South American natives."

It was the most successful of Grétry's large-scale works that are lighter in tone: it received over 500 performances at the Paris Opera up to 1829, being billed every year between 1785 and 1791, and, except for 1818, between 1806 and 1828, besides enjoying further irregular stagings during the Revolutionary period."

Originally it would have referred only to \"A breakbeat\" (1), a section of a song in which, typically, all or at least most of the instruments stop for a period, usually around one bar, except from the drums, which would continue the melody even if altered. Since the rise of electronic music it can now also refer to the electronic music genre \"Breakbeat\" (2), characterized, simply put, as a genre of around 140bpm with a kick drum on 1st and 3rd beats, and a snare on the 2nd and 4th beats in a 4/4 beat pattern. This varies the music greatly from the steady beat used in house, techno and trance etc., which while often sharing a snare on the 2nd and 4th beats, are characterized by a kick drum on every beat.Breakbeats, as in \"A breakbeat\" (1) have been known and used for around a hundred years, and are widely known for being sampled by many early producers of hip hop, where the \"break\" in a song, usually only a few seconds long, is looped to create basis for an entire new song. This sampling has continued up until today, and the original \"breakbeats\" from songs from the 1950s, 60s, 70s have been used in thousands of more recent songs since the rise of electonic music in the 1980s. Today, breakbeats live on as a part of many songs from many electronic music genres such as hip hop, jungle or drum and bass, hardcore, UK garage (including 2-step, breakstep and dubstep), and even pop and rock.",

It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of American folk music and Western music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. The term country music gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term hillbilly music; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term country music is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of mostly white, working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.",

It developed in the Southern United States from rock and roll, country music, and blues, and is focused generally on electric guitar and vocals. Although the origin of the term Southern rock is unknown, \"many people feel that these important contributors to the development of rock and roll have been minimized in rock's history.\" The Allman Brothers Band played blues rock with long jams. Loosely associated with the first wave of Southern rock were acts like Barefoot Jerry and Charlie Daniels. In the early 1970s, another wave of hard rock Southern groups emerged. Their music emphasized boogie rhythms and fast guitar leads with lyrics extolling the values, aspirations - and excesses - of Southern working-class young adults, not unlike the outlaw country movement. Examples include The Marshall Tucker Band, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Molly Hatchet, Atlanta Rhythm Section and Blackfoot. Bands such as Drivin N Cryin, Dash Rip Rock, and Kentucky Headhunters emerged as popular Southern bands across the Southeastern United States during the 1980s and 1990s. The Georgia Satellites also had some widespread popularity in the mid to late 1980s.[citation needed] Some rock groups from the South, such as Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and The Fabulous Thunderbirds incorporated Southern musical and lyrical themes.[citation needed] The 1990s also saw the influence of Southern rock touching metal. In 2001, Kid Rock went from a rock/rapper to a southern rocker/country singer. Southern rock currently plays on the radio in the United States, but mostly on oldies stations and classic rock stations. [clarification needed] Additionally, alternative rock groups like Kings of Leon combine Southern rock with garage rock, alt-country, and blues rock. Several of the original early 1970s hard rock Southern rock groups are still performing today, such as Lynyrd Skynyrd, ZZ Top, and Canned Heat.",

Baltimore club is based on an 8/4 beat structure, and includes tempos around 130 beats per minute. It combines repetitive, looped vocal snippets similar to trap, bounce, ghetto house and ghettotech. Baltimore club is a sample based form of breakbeat, with samples used including theme songs to shows like Sanford and Son, SpongeBob SquarePants and Elmo's World, along with samples from shows like Family Guy and South Park though can also be simple repeated phrases and chants. The instrumental tracks include heavy breakbeats and call and response stanzas similar to those found in the go-go music of Washington, D.C.. The breakbeats are pulled from samples, with the most prominent being \"Sing Sing\" by disco band Gaz and \"Think (About It)\" by Lyn Collins. Much like the rave-era genre known as breakbeat hardcore, Baltimore club sounds as if the music was intentionally hurried, as each song is made with a limited palette of sounds and is based on similar frameworks.[citation needed]",

      "description": "Soul music is a popular music genre that originated in the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It combines elements of African-American gospel music, rhythm and blues and jazz. Soul music became popular for dancing and listening in the United States; where record labels such as Motown, Atlantic and Stax were influential in the civil rights era. Soul also became popular around the world, directly influencing rock music and the music of Africa. According to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, soul is \"music that arose out of the black experience in America through the transmutation of gospel and rhythm & blues into a form of funky, secular testifying\". Catchy rhythms, stressed by handclaps and extemporaneous body moves, are an important feature of soul music. Other characteristics are a call and response between the lead vocalist and the chorus and an especially tense vocal sound. The style also occasionally uses improvisational additions, twirls and auxiliary sounds. Soul music reflected the African-American identity and it stressed the importance of an African-American culture. The new-found African-American consciousness led to new styles of music, which boasted pride in being black. Soul music dominated the U.S. R&B chart in the 1960s, and many recordings crossed over into the pop charts in the U.S., Britain and elsewhere. By 1968, the soul music genre had begun to splinter. Some soul artists developed funk music, while other singers and groups developed slicker, more sophisticated, and in some cases more politically conscious varieties. By the early 1970s, soul music had been influenced by psychedelic rock and other genres, leading to psychedelic soul. The United States saw the development of neo soul around 1994. There are also several other subgenres and offshoots of soul music. The key subgenres of soul include the Detroit (Motown) style, a rhythmic music influenced by gospel; deep soul and southern soul, driving, energetic soul styles combining R&B with southern gospel music sounds; Memphis soul, a shimmering, sultry style; New Orleans soul, which came out of the rhythm and blues style; Chicago soul, a lighter gospel-influenced sound; Philadelphia soul, a lush orchestral sound with doo-wop-inspired vocals; Psychedelic soul, a blend of psychedelic rock and soul music; as well as categories such as Blue-eyed soul, which is soul music performed by white artists; British soul; and Northern soul, rare soul music played by DJs at nightclubs in Northern England.",

      "description": "Europop (also Euro pop) refers to a style of pop music that originates in Europe in the 1960s and developed to today's form throughout the late 1970s. Europop topped the charts throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Many successful Europop artists came from France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom. In the 1970s and early 1980s, such groups were primarily popular in continental countries, with the exception of ABBA (1972–1983). The Swedish four-piece band achieved great success in the UK, where they scored nineteen top 10 singles and nine chart-topping albums, and in North America and Australia. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Roxette and Ace of Base led Europop in American and British mainstream audiences. In the 1990s, pop groups like the Spice Girls, Aqua, Backstreet Boys and singer DJ BoBo were strongly influenced by Europop. Throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Italian dance group Eiffel 65 were highly active in this genre. In the 2000s, one of the most popular representatives of Europop music was Swedish pop group Alcazar. One of the main differences between American and European pop is that Europop is generally more dance and trance oriented. In central Europe, Italo disco (a.k.a. '80s Euro disco) and Euro house (a.k.a. '90s Eurodance) were the predominant attempts by young musicians to have a hit record in and beyond the borders of their own country.",

Released on 26 November 1984, the single spent six weeks in the UK charts over Christmas 1984 and new year of 1985, and reached number 21. The song was not originally released on any Queen studio album, appearing only on Queen's Greatest Hits III, released in 1999, and as the B-side of the single \"A Winter's Tale\" from the 1995 album Made in Heaven. However, the track was finally included on the bonus EP packaged with the deluxe edition of their album The Works, remastered and re-released in 2011. No promotional video was filmed for the track, hampering its future use on music TV channels. For that reason it is a lesser known Christmas single. The song appears on several Christmas compilation albums. One of them is the original Now That's What I Call Christmas compilation released in 1985 but deleted in 1989. It appears on the Christmas compilation LP The Edge Of Christmas in its full 12\" version with the drum intro. It also appears on the US-only compilation boxed-set The Queen Collection, which consisted of a re-release of the LPs Classic Queen and Queen's Greatest Hits along with a bonus CD called Queen Talks that included this song, along with a 1989 interview with the band.[citation needed]"

      "description": "Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \"rock and roll\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources. Musically, rock has centered on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with electric bass guitar and drums. Typically, rock is song-based music usually with a 4/4 time signature using a verse-chorus form, but the genre has become extremely diverse. Like pop music, lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political in emphasis. The dominance of rock by white, male musicians has been seen as one of the key factors shaping the themes explored in rock music. Rock places a higher degree of emphasis on musicianship, live performance, and an ideology of authenticity than pop music. By the late 1960s, referred to as the \"golden age\" or \"classic rock\" period, a number of distinct rock music subgenres had emerged, including hybrids like blues rock, folk rock, country rock, raga rock, and jazz-rock fusion, many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock, which was influenced by the countercultural psychedelic scene. New genres that emerged from this scene included progressive rock, which extended the artistic elements; glam rock, which highlighted showmanship and visual style; and the diverse and enduring subgenre of heavy metal, which emphasized volume, power, and speed. In the second half of the 1970s, punk rock reacted against the perceived overblown, inauthentic and overly mainstream aspects of these genres to produce a stripped-down, energetic form of music valuing raw expression and often lyrically characterised by social and political critiques. Punk was an influence into the 1980s on the subsequent development of other subgenres, including new wave, post-punk and eventually the alternative rock movement. From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break through into the mainstream in the form of grunge, Britpop, and indie rock. Further fusion subgenres have since emerged, including pop punk, rap rock, and rap metal, as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock's history, including the garage rock/post-punk and synthpop revivals at the beginning of the new millennium. Rock music has also embodied and served as the vehicle for cultural and social movements, leading to major sub-cultures including mods and rockers in the UK and the hippie counterculture that spread out from San Francisco in the US in the 1960s. Similarly, 1970s punk culture spawned the visually distinctive goth and emo subcultures. Inheriting the folk tradition of the protest song, rock music has been associated with political activism as well as changes in social attitudes to race, sex and drug use, and is often seen as an expression of youth revolt against adult consumerism and conformity.",

      "description": "Blues rock is a fusion genre combining elements of blues and rock. It is mostly an electric ensemble-style music with instrumentation similar to electric blues and rock. From its beginnings in the early- to mid-1960s, blues rock has gone through several stylistic shifts and along the way inspired hard rock, Southern rock, and heavy metal. Blues rock continues to be an influence, with performances and recordings by several popular artists. Blues rock started with rock musicians in the United Kingdom and the United States performing American blues songs. They typically recreated electric Chicago-style blues songs, such as those by Muddy Waters, Jimmy Reed, Howlin' Wolf, and Albert King, at faster tempos and with a more aggressive sound common to rock. In the UK, the style was popularized by groups such as the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds, and the Animals, who managed to place blues songs into the pop charts. In the US, Lonnie Mack, the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, and Canned Heat were among the earliest exponents and \"attempted to play long, involved improvisations which were commonplace on jazz records\". John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers and Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac also developed this more instrumental, but traditional-based style in the UK, while late-1960s/early 1970s groups, including Ten Years After, Savoy Brown, and Foghat became more hard rock oriented. In the US, Johnny Winter, the Allman Brothers Band, and ZZ Top represented a hard rock trend. Although around this time, AllMusic commented, \"the lines between blues rock and hard rock were barely visible\", there was a return to more blues-influenced styles. In the 1980s, the Fabulous Thunderbirds and Stevie Ray Vaughan, recorded their best-known works and 1990s saw guitarists Gary Moore, Jeff Healy, and Kenny Wayne Shepherd become popular concert attractions. Groups, such as the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion and the White Stripes, brought an edgier, more diverse style into the 2000s, as do contemporary artists the Black Keys.",

Hundreds of recordings have been made in folk, blues, jazz, country, and pop styles; some of the more notable versions include those by Bessie Smith, Marilyn Lee, Ottilie Patterson, Pete Seeger, and George Lewis. Big Joe Turner recorded it several times over his long career. T. Texas Tyler recorded a version in 1946 for 4-Star records. Fats Domino made a recording of it in 1951, and it has also been sung by Elvis Presley, Eddy Arnold, Entrance, Louis Armstrong, Eartha Kitt, Lonnie Johnson, Blind Boy Fuller, Dave Van Ronk, Lead Belly, Odetta, Lee Wiley, Janis Joplin, Siouxsie Sioux, Joan Baez, Ray Charles, Ace Cannon, Ronnie Lane, Dr. John, Madeleine Peyroux, Bob Dylan, Bill Monroe and Johnny Cash, Frankie Laine, Skip James, Snooks Eaglin, Harry Connick Jr., French composer and clarinettist Jean-Christian Michel and Italian songwriter and singer Lucio Dalla in his debut single in 1964 and Hugh Laurie on his 2013 album Didn't It Rain. Kenny Davern made a clarinet recording of Careless Love. The song's melody also is used in other blues songs, notably \"A bunch of thyme\" and Moon Mullican's \"Worries on my mind\". Elements of the Bessie Smith version's melody show up in Jerry Lee Lewis's 1956 version of \"Crazy Arms\" as well."

      "description": "Klezmer (Yiddish: כליזמר or קלעזמער (klezmer), pl.: כליזמרים (klezmorim), כליזמר from Hebrew: כלי זמר — instruments of music) is a musical tradition of the Ashkenazi Jews of Eastern Europe. Played by professional musicians called klezmorim, the genre originally consisted largely of dance tunes and instrumental display pieces for weddings and other celebrations. In the United States the genre evolved considerably as Yiddish-speaking Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe, who arrived between 1880 and 1924, met and assimilated American jazz. During the initial years after the klezmer revival of the 1970s, this was what most people knew as klezmer, although in the current century musicians have begun paying more attention to the \"original\" pre-jazz traditions as revivalists including Josh Horowitz, Yale Strom, and Bob Cohen have spent years doing field research in Eastern/Central Europe. Additionally, later immigrants from the Soviet Union such as German Goldenshtayn took their surviving repertoires to the United States and Israel in the 1980s. Compared with most other European folk music styles, little is known about the history of klezmer music, and much of what is said about it must be seen as conjecture.",

The opera tells a tale of necromancy and betrayal among a Navajo tribe. Music critic Bill Zakariasen wrote in his review of the opera in Musical America, \"This muddled tale of necromancy among the Navajos only turned our understanding of these people back to a wigwam one. Anderson's music, despite its lack of authentic racial atmosphere, proved well-orchestrated, smoothly developed, and firmly attuned to the dramatic action.\""

Versions of the song were collected by folklorist Helen Creighton, first in 1933 from Ann Greenough in Petpeswick, Nova Scotia, and then from other singers in surrounding communities along the province's Eastern Shore. It is believed to have been written just prior to or during the First World War. \"Farewell to Nova Scotia\" brings the listener back to an age when Nova Scotia was renowned for \"wooden ships and iron men\". The song appears in the Penguin Book of Canadian Folk Songs. In 1808 a Glasgow newspaper printed \"The Soldier's Adieu\", attributed to Robert Tannahill. It has several lines and phrases in it that suggest it was a source of inspiration for the song. The song is catalogued as Roud Folk Song Index No. 384."

Minor controversy ensued in 1989 when a U.S. record called \"Turn Up the Bass\" by Tyree Cooper featuring Kool Rock Steady claimed it was the \"first hip house record on vinyl\". The Beatmasters disputed this, pointing out that \"Rok Da House\" had originally been written and pressed to vinyl in 1986. The outfit then released \"Who’s in the House?\" featuring British emcee Merlin, containing the lines \"Beatmasters stand to attention, hip house is your invention\" and \"Watch out Tyree, we come faster\". More claims to the hip-house crown were subsequently laid down in tracks by Fast Eddie, Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock, and Toni Scott.",

      "description": "Bluegrass music is a form of American roots music, and a related genre of country music. Influenced by the music of Appalachia, Bluegrass has mixed roots in Irish, Scottish, Welsh, and English traditional music, and was also later influenced by the music of African-Americans through incorporation of jazz elements. Settlers from the United Kingdom and Ireland arrived in Appalachia during the 18th century, and brought with them the musical traditions of their homelands. These traditions consisted primarily of English and Scottish ballads—which were essentially unaccompanied narrative—and dance music, such as Irish reels, which were accompanied by a fiddle. Many older bluegrass songs come directly from the British Isles. Several Appalachian bluegrass ballads, such as \"Pretty Saro\", \"Barbara Allen\", \"Cuckoo Bird\" and \"House Carpenter\", come from England and preserve the English ballad tradition both melodically and lyrically. Others, such as The Twa Sisters, also come from England; however, the lyrics are about Ireland. Some bluegrass fiddle songs popular in Appalachia, such as \"Leather Britches\", and \"Pretty Polly\", have Scottish roots. The dance tune Cumberland Gap may be derived from the tune that accompanies the Scottish ballad Bonnie George Campbell. Other songs have different names in different places; for instance in England there is an old ballad known as \"A Brisk Young Sailor Courted Me\", but exactly the same song in North American bluegrass is known as \"I Wish My Baby Was Born\". In bluegrass, as in some forms of jazz, one or more instruments each takes its turn playing the melody and improvising around it, while the others perform accompaniment; this is especially typified in tunes called breakdowns. This is in contrast to old-time music, in which all instruments play the melody together or one instrument carries the lead throughout while the others provide accompaniment. Breakdowns are often characterized by rapid tempos and unusual instrumental dexterity and sometimes by complex chord changes. There are three major subgenres of bluegrass and one unofficial subgenre. Traditional bluegrass has musicians playing folk songs, tunes with simple traditional chord progressions, and using only acoustic instruments, with an example being Bill Monroe. Progressive bluegrass groups may use electric instruments and import songs from other genres, particularly rock & roll. Examples include Cadillac Sky and Bearfoot. \"Bluegrass gospel\" has emerged as a third subgenre, which uses Christian lyrics, soulful three- or four-part harmony singing, and sometimes the playing of instrumentals. A newer development in the bluegrass world is Neo-traditional bluegrass; exemplified by bands such as The Grascals and Mountain Heart, bands from this subgenre typically have more than one lead singer. Bluegrass music has attracted a diverse following worldwide. Bluegrass pioneer Bill Monroe characterized the genre as: \"Scottish bagpipes and ole-time fiddlin'. It's Methodist and Holiness and Baptist. It's blues and jazz, and it has a high lonesome sound.\"",

      "description": "Jam bands are musical groups whose live albums and concerts relate to a unique fan culture that began in the 1960s with The Grateful Dead, and continued with The Allman Brothers Band, which had lengthy jams at concerts. The performances of these bands typically feature extended musical improvisation (\"jams\") over rhythmic grooves and chord patterns, and long sets of music that can often cross genre boundaries. The Grateful Dead continued to grow their fanbase in the second half of the 1980s. In the mid-1980s the bands Phish, Edie Brickell & New Bohemians, Blues Traveler, Ozric Tentacles, Widespread Panic, Bela Fleck and the Flecktones, Spin Doctors, Col Bruce Hampton and Aquarium Rescue Unit, began touring with Jam band-style concerts. In the early 1990s, a new generation of bands was spurred on by The Grateful Dead's touring and the increased exposure of The Black Crowes, Phish, Dave Matthews Band, Widespread Panic and Aquarium Rescue Unit. Many of today's jam bands have brought widely varied genres into the scene. A jam band festival may include bands with electronic, folk rock, blues rock, jazz fusion, psychedelic rock, southern rock, progressive rock, acid jazz, hip hop, hard rock, and bluegrass sounds. The electronic trend has been led by such bands as The Disco Biscuits, Sound Tribe Sector 9 (STS9), Lotus, EOTO, The New Deal. Bands like moe., Umphrey's McGee, Assembly of Dust, The Heavy Pets and The Breakfast have carried on the classic rock sound mixed with exploratory jams. Members of The Grateful Dead have continued touring in many different configurations as The Dead, Bob Weir & Ratdog, Phil Lesh and Friends, 7 Walkers, and Furthur. The contemporary jam scene has grown to encompass bands from a great diversity of musical genres. While the seminal group The Grateful Dead are categorized as psychedelic rock, by the 1990s the term \"jam band\" was being used for groups playing a variety of rock-related genres, including blues, country music, folk music, and funk. Today the term even includes some groups completely outside of rock, such as those playing world music, electronic music, progressive bluegrass, and jazz fusion. By the late 1990s, the types of jam bands had grown so that the term became quite broad. By the late 1990s use of the term jam band also became ambiguous. Although in 2007 the term may have been used to describe nearly any cross-genre band, festival band, or improvisational band, the term retains an affinity to Grateful Dead-like bands such as Phish. Some artists such as The Derek Trucks Band are known for resisting the jam band label. A unique feature of the jam band scene is fan taping or digital recording of live concerts. While many other styles of music term fan taping as \"illegal bootlegging\", jam bands often allow their fans to make tapes or recordings of their live shows. Fans trade recordings and collect recordings of different live shows because improvisational jam bands play their songs differently at each performance. By the 2000s, as internet downloading of MP3 music files became common, downloading of jam band songs became an extension of the cassette taping trend. Archived jam band downloads are available at various websites, the most prominent ones being etree and the Live Music Archive, which is part of the Internet Archive. More bands have been distributing their latest shows online. Bands such as Phish, Widespread Panic, The String Cheese Incident, Gov't Mule, ekoostik hookah, Umphrey's McGee, Lotus, and The Disco Biscuits have been offering digital downloads within days, or sometimes hours, of concerts.",

In this instance, the word \"alternative\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \"alternative\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). Alternative rock is a broad umbrella term consisting of music that differs greatly in terms of its sound, its social context, and its regional roots. By the end of the 1980s magazines and zines, college radio airplay, and word of mouth had increased the prominence and highlighted the diversity of alternative rock, helping to define a number of distinct styles (and music scenes) such as gothic rock, jangle pop, noise pop, indie rock, indie pop, grunge, industrial rock, alternative hip hop, and rap rock. Most of these subgenres had achieved minor mainstream notice and a few bands representing them, such as Hüsker Dü and R.E.M., had even signed to major labels. But most alternative bands' commercial success was limited in comparison to other genres of rock and pop music at the time, and most acts remained signed to independent labels and received relatively little attention from mainstream radio, television, or newspapers. With the breakthrough of Nirvana and the popularity of the grunge and Britpop movements in the 1990s, alternative rock entered the musical mainstream and many alternative bands became successful. By the end of the decade, alternative rock's mainstream prominence declined due to a number of events that caused grunge and Britpop to fade and led to the hiatus of the Lollapalooza festival. Nevertheless, post-grunge remained commercially viable into the start of the 21st century, with the commercial success of Creed and Matchbox Twenty; Radiohead's critical acclaim, and the success of some post-Britpop groups like Coldplay. Emo attracted attention in the larger alternative rock world, and the term was applied to a variety of artists, including multi-platinum acts. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, several alternative rock bands emerged, including The White Stripes, The Strokes, Arcade Fire, Franz Ferdinand, and Interpol, that drew from post-punk and new wave. Post-punk revival artists such as Modest Mouse and The Killers had commercial success in the early and mid 2000s.",

It features a danceable sound with heavy synthpop influences (such as song structure, focus on lyrics and vocal style) and epic trance (grandiose and arpeggiated synthesizer melodies) to create a techno-beat-driven, club-oriented music. Some songs in the genre have become popular in alternative dance clubs, particularly in Germany. Futurepop music is popular in the cyber youth culture and general alternative electronic music scenes. Music festivals that feature Futurepop bands include Infest, Amphi festival, Wave Gotik Treffen and M'era Luna.",

(Caccini wrote his own \"Euridice\" even as he supplied music to Peri's opera, published this version before Peri's was performed, in 1600, and got it staged two years later.) The libretto by Ottavio Rinuccini is based on books X and XI of Ovid's Metamorphoseswhich recount the story of the legendary musician Orpheus and his wife Euridice. The opera was first performed in Florence on 6 October 1600 at the Palazzo Pitti with Peri himself singing the role of Orfeo."

It is divided between the counties of Marshall, Panola, Tate and Lafayette, and straddles the ecoregions of North Hilly Plain (Red Clay Hills or North Central Hills), the Loess Plains, and Bluff Hills. The hills have poor agricultural soil and wide forested areas, which led to the developments of only small farms, and a lumber industry. Holly Springs and Oxford, Mississippi are often cited as centers of Hill Country music. The style is regarded as distinct from the blues of the Mississippi delta, which lays west of the hills. An annual picnic is held to celebrate the region and music.",

Barber was commissioned to write his cello concerto for Raya Garbousova, an expatriate Russian cellist, by Serge Koussevitzky on behalf of Garbusova and the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Funds for the commission were supplied, however, by John Nicholas Brown, an amateur cellist and a trustee of the Boston Symphony Orchestra (, 248). The score is dedicated to John and Anne Brown (, 1). Barber was still on active duty with the U. S. Army at the time he received the commission, and before beginning work asked Garbousova to play through her repertoire for him so that he could understand her particular performing style and the resources of the instrument (, 249). Garbousova premiered it with the Boston Symphony Orchestra in Symphony Hall, Boston, on 5 April 1946, followed by New York performances at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on 12 and 13 April (, 252). The concerto won Barber the New York Music Critics' Circle Award in 1947 (, 257). The work has remained obscure and performances are scarce, largely because of its extreme technical demands, but also because the heavy editing of the solo part by Garbousova hinders individual interpretation (, 34). The work has three movements: The concerto is scored for solo cello and an orchestra consisting of 2 flutes, oboe, English horn, 2 clarinets (second doubling bass clarinet), 2 bassoons, 2 horns, 3 trumpets, timpani, snare drum, and strings."

It is frequently used in sports or whenever a challenge such as a difficult test or unpleasant assignment is met. It derives from a Konglish misuse of the English word \"Fighting!\" In English, \"fighting\" is an adjective (specifically, a present participle) whereas cheers and exclamations of support usually take the form of imperative verbs. Paiting!’s Japanese equivalent, for example, is the more proper Faito! (ファイト). For that reason, paiting! is often translated in English as \"Come on!\" or \"Let's go!\" Daehan Mingug Paiting! (\"대한민국 파이팅!\") might be glossed as \"Go, Korea!\" English does sometimes use adjectives and nouns as words of support (\"Good!\" \"Good job!\") but the original meaning of fighting simply implies some conflict exists; it doesn't imply either side will be victorious and offers no support. Within Korean, paiting! serves as an encouragement to release one's inhibitions and draw on inner power. Paiting! is often accompanied by the expression Aja aja! (Hangul: 아자 아자), which has a similar meaning. The pronunciation Hwaiting, despite often being used colloquially, is not included in important Korean dictionaries such as The Standard Dictionary of the Korean Language (표준국어대사전)."

These include Memphis, Detroit, Chicago, Texas, Piedmont, Louisiana, West Coast, St. Louis, East Coast, Swamp, New Orleans, Delta, Hill country and Kansas City blues. When African-American musical tastes began to change in the early 1960s, moving toward soul and rhythm and blues music, country blues found renewed popularity as \"folk blues\" and was sold to a primarily white, college-age audience. Traditional artists like Big Bill Broonzy and Sonny Boy Williamson II reinvented themselves as folk blues artists, while Piedmont bluesmen like Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee found great success on the folk festival circuit. Seminal compilations of pre-WWII country blues recordings assembled in the 1950s are the Anthology of American Folk Music and The Country Blues.",

      "description": "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Piano Sonata No. 1 in C major, K 279 (189d) (1774) is a sonata in three movements. It was composed when Mozart was only 18 years old and is the first of a set of 18 piano sonatas written by Mozart. All but 2 of the sonatas, No. 8 in A minor and No. 14 in C minor are in a major key. The first of Mozart's Piano Sonatas seem to follow the cycle of fifths, to the flat side first (No. 1 in C major, No. 2 in F major, No. 3 in B-flat major, No. 4 in E-flat major) and then to the sharp side (No. 5 in G major, No. 6 in D major). 1. Allegro The first movement, marked Allegro, is structured in sonata form; the exposition opens with a turning figure for the left hand, which forms the basis for much of this movement. After a repeat of the opening 2 bars, an Alberti bass is introduced for the left hand, whilst the right hand plays the melody based on the opening turning figure. The opening section uses chromatic appogiaturas for colour. An imperfect cadence leads towards the dominant (G major) in preparation for the 2nd subject, as expected. The second subject focuses on rapid scales and leads to a perfect cadence in G major, ready for the development section. The exposition is repeated, which is standard for sonata form. The development begins in G minor uses the opening theme to follow a series of ascending arpeggios in several keys before moving towards G major and then back to the tonic, C major, for the recapitulation. The recapitulation follows a similar structure to the exposition, although the imperfect cadence that led to the dominant previously now leads to the final 10 bars of the exposition, this time in the tonic key. The first movement ends with a perfect cadence and a three bar elaboration on the tonic. 2. Andante The Andante is full of expressive shading, the result of Mozart's harmonic freedom. This movement is based in F major, the subdominant of the whole work's tonal home and is structured in sonata form. By the end of the exposition, Mozart has modulated to the dominant, C major and begins the development in this key. The work then quickly makes temporary transitions through G and D minor, in order to move back to the tonic for the recapitulation, which follows the exposition closely. 3. Allegro The Allegro zips along in its 24 meter and is based in C major. This features an unusually active part for the left hand, another extended development section, and a surprising close: Mozart rounds the sonata off with two firm chords, which he marks Coda. A typical performance takes about 14 minutes. The work was written down, except for the first part of the opening movement, during the visit Mozart paid to Munich for the production of La finta giardiniera from late 1774 to the beginning of the following March."

Modern J-pop has its roots in traditional Japanese music, but significantly in 1960s pop and rock music, such as The Beatles and The Beach Boys, which led to Japanese rock bands such as Happy End fusing rock with Japanese music in the early 1970s. J-pop was further defined by new wave groups in the late 1970s, particularly electronic synthpop band Yellow Magic Orchestra and pop rock band Southern All Stars. Eventually, J-pop replaced kayōkyoku (\"Lyric Singing Music\", a term for Japanese pop music from the 1920s to the 1980s) in the Japanese music scene. The term was coined by the Japanese media to distinguish Japanese music from foreign music, and now refers to most Japanese popular music. The musical genre has been immensely influential in many other music styles, and hence those of neighboring regions, where the style has been copied by neighboring Asian regions, who have also borrowed the name to form their own musical identities.[citation needed]",

The opera was composed in 1992 for the British soprano Jane Manning who sang the title role in the first performance with Pal Rullestad (tenor) and Tracy Chadwell (soprano) in supporting roles. The work also has significant roles for two young singers as Gerda and Kay, the heroic children in the story and a chorus of treble voices. The work is scored for a small ensemble of eight players with conductor: string trio, flute/piccolo/alto flute, clarinet/bass clarinet, piano/celesta and percussion. The pianist also has to play a melodian. At one point, the conductor is required to play a French horn. The wide-ranging musical narrative involves a plethora of musical styles. A review of the first performance described King as being \"like a bright Hollywood composer with a sense of humour\" and, after a subsequent performance at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London, another reviewer suggested that the opera contained '\"music of distinctive beauty with disarming theatre sense.'\""

      "description": "Michael Haydn's Symphony No. 39 in C major, Perger 31, Sherman 39, MH 478, written in Salzburg in 1788, is the last C major symphony he wrote, the sixth of his final set of six symphonies. The symphony is scored for 2 oboes, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, timpani and strings. The edition by H. C. Robbins Landon for Verlag Doblinger has the cellos and basses on the same staff for most of the work even though the cellos occasionally are independent of the bassoons and basses in the first movement. Close to the beginning of the third movement it becomes necessary to split the cellos and basses on to different staves as the cellos switch to tenor clef and double the violas, leaving the bass to the bassoons and basses. The three movements are: The first movement is notable for its use of horns in G instead of the usual horns in C (compare Haydn's earlier C major symphonies and those of his brother Joseph), so that the horns can participate in the harmonization of ii chords. The music begins straightaway with a triadic theme and bass on the beat, offset by half-beat syncopation in the second violins and violas. For the recapitulation, the horns change to horns in C. There are even more horn crook changes in store for the players: in the second movement, the first horn switches to horn in E while the second player switches to horn in D, \"a clever use ... to increase the range of notes available on instruments without valves.\" Robbins Landon also points out that in the Andante of this symphony of Haydn's uses the low C of the second trumpet, something Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart also did later when he wrote his Symphony No. 41 in C major (also written in 1788). The last movement is a vigorous fugato, something else this work has in common with Mozart's Symphony No. 41 and Haydn's own Symphony No. 28 in C major which Mozart certainly studied. Unlike the \"Jupiter\" Symphony, in this symphony the fugal theme is at its first instance accompanied by its usual countersubject: Robbins Landon speculates that Mozart also studied Haydn's No. 39 before writing his No. 41, since he \"often requested his father Leopold to send him the latest fugue that Haydn had written.\" (Robbins Landon, 1967) Whether Mozart knew Haydn's later C major symphony has not been proven conclusively by historical means, but Alfred Einstein ranks among the convinced, because of comparisons of the music. As in the first movement, in the last movement the two horns again begin in G and switch to in C for the recapitulation. According to Leopold Mozart, Michael Haydn considered continuo to be essential even for his most fully instrumented works. Yet only one recording of Symphony No. 39 uses harpsichord continuo, Pál Németh with Capella Savaria; the bass line for the figured bass realization is the bassoons' and not the celli's. Neither Johannes Goritzki nor Hans-Peter Frank have continuo in their recordings."

It was first performed on 6 April 1813 by the Académie Impériale de Musique (Paris Opera) at the Salle Montansier, with Napoleon and his wife, the Empress Marie-Louise, in the audience. The opera was initially a success but its popularity waned after the fall of Napoleon. Because of its use of large choruses, spectacle and extensive dance music as well as its story line of a love affair played out against the background of major historical events, Les Abencérages is considered an important precursor of French grand opera. Almanzor's tenor aria, Suspendez de ses murs, was admired by composers such as Berlioz and has been recorded by singers including Georges Thill and Roberto Alagna. The ballet music in the first act contains variations on the popular melody La Follia (known in French as Les folies d'Espagne)."

Most definitions of Latin music also include Portuguese-language music from Brazil and sometimes Portugal as well. The term, \"Latin music\", originates from the United States (US) due to the growing influence of Hispanic and Latino Americans in the American music market beginning in the 1980s. US trade industry groups such as Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and Billboard magazine define \"Latin music\" as any type of release with most of its lyrics in Spanish regardless of genre. Major record labels such as Universal Music Group, Sony Music, and Warner Music have divisions which oversees acts from Latin America and the Iberian Peninsula with an executive that manages both regions. Spain, Brazil, Mexico, and the United States are the largest Latin music markets in the world. In the 1990s, artists from Italy such as Eros Ramazzotti, Laura Pausini, and Tiziano Ferro successfully crossed over to the Latin music field by recording Spanish-language versions of their songs. In 2000, the Latin Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences (LARAS) established the Latin Grammy Awards to recognize musicians who perform in Spanish or Portuguese. Unlike the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS) which only accepts recordings that been released in the United States, LARAS admits any recordings in Spanish or Portuguese that have been released in Latin America, Spain, Portugal, and the United States. Similarly, the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame was established in 2012 to recognize songwriters from Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking regions around the world. In 2013, Spanish singer Julio Iglesias was recognized by the Guinness World Records as the best-selling male Latin artist of all time.",

      "description": "Grunge (sometimes referred to as the Seattle sound) is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged during the mid-1980s in the American state of Washington, particularly in Seattle. The early grunge movement revolved around Seattle's independent record label Sub Pop, but by the early 1990s its popularity had spread, with grunge acts in California and other parts of the U.S. building strong followings and signing major record deals. Grunge became commercially successful in the first half of the 1990s, due mainly to the release of Nirvana's Nevermind, Pearl Jam's Ten, Soundgarden's Badmotorfinger, Alice in Chains' Dirt, and Stone Temple Pilots' Core. The success of these bands boosted the popularity of alternative rock and made grunge the most popular form of hard rock music at the time. Although most grunge bands had disbanded or faded from view by the late 1990s, their influence continues to affect modern rock music. Grunge typically fuses elements of punk rock and heavy metal, such as the distorted electric guitar used in both genres, although some bands performed with more emphasis on one or the other. The music shares with punk a raw sound and similar lyrical concerns. However, it also involves much slower tempos, dissonant harmonies, and more complex instrumentation—which is reminiscent of heavy metal. Lyrics are typically angst-filled, often addressing themes such as social alienation, apathy, confinement, and a desire for freedom. Grunge bands had made inroads to the musical mainstream in the late 1980s. Soundgarden was the first grunge band to sign to a major label when they joined the roster of A&M Records in 1989. A number of factors contributed to grunge's decline in prominence. During the mid-1990s many grunge bands broke up or became less visible. Nirvana's Kurt Cobain, labeled by Time as \"the John Lennon of the swinging Northwest\", appeared unusually tortured by success and \"struggled with an addiction to heroin before he allegedly committed suicide at the age of 27 in 1994\".",

Since mid-1990s and further into the 2000s, a number of new bands have emerged that played original compositions intended to imitate the sound of deep funk bands. The concept usually includes using vintage musical instruments and recording equipment, as well as distribution via analogue record discs. However, an updated tighter sound is not uncommon as well. Stylistically, nu funk is somewhat close to jam bands. Nu-funk originated in Brooklyn in the 1980s[citation needed]. The music was slow[citation needed], riff-oriented and danceable. Listeners would often dance and \"jive\" during the riffs. Unlike original funk that was primarily US-based, nu funk is a worldwide phenomenon. Most notable bands such as The Quantic Soul Orchestra and The New Mastersounds come from the UK. Other countries are also well represented with bands like The Poets of Rhythm from Germany and The Bamboos from Australia. Since the late 2000s however, the Nu-Funk sound has adapted influences from hip hop, funky breaks, dubstep and big beat and became a more diverse sample-based form of music but keeping with the funk motif. This style of nu-funk has been popularised by the likes of Featurecast and A Skillz, and is usually played around 100-120 BPM. A notable label of this kind of Nu-Funk is Boogie Boutique Records (London, UK)and the GoodGroove Records label in Bath, UK.",

      "description": "Gospel music is a music genre in Christian music. The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of gospel music varies according to culture and social context. Gospel music is composed and performed for many purposes, including aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, and as an entertainment product for the marketplace. Gospel music usually has dominant vocals (often with strong use of harmony) with Christian lyrics. Gospel music can be traced to the early 17th century, with roots in the black oral tradition. Hymns and sacred songs were repeated in a call and response fashion. Most of the churches relied on hand clapping and foot stomping as rhythmic accompaniment. Most of the singing was done a cappella. The first published use of the term ″Gospel Song\" probably appeared in 1874. The original gospel songs were written and composed by authors such as George F. Root, Philip Bliss, Charles H. Gabriel, William Howard Doane, and Fanny Crosby. Gospel music publishing houses emerged. The advent of radio in the 1920s greatly increased the audience for gospel music. Following World War II, gospel music moved into major auditoriums, and gospel music concerts became quite elaborate. Gospel blues is a blues-based form of gospel music (a combination of blues guitar and evangelistic lyrics). Southern gospel used all male, tenor-lead-baritone-bass quartet make-up. Progressive Southern gospel is an American music genre that has grown out of Southern gospel over the past couple of decades. Christian country music, sometimes referred to as country gospel music, is a subgenre of gospel music with a country flair. It peaked in popularity in the middle 1990s. Bluegrass gospel music is rooted in American mountain music. Celtic gospel music infuses gospel music with a Celtic flair, and is quite popular in countries such as Ireland. British black gospel refers to Gospel music of the African diaspora, which has been produced in the UK. Some proponents of \"standard\" hymns generally dislike gospel music of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Today, with historical distance, there is a greater acceptance of such gospel songs into official denominational hymnals.",

Of the 93 children and 10 sisters in the orphanage, only three teenage boys survived. As a result of this event, the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word across the world sing this song every year on September 8, and remember the sisters and orphans that died that day. The Sisters of Charity created an audio CD titled Queen of the Waves: Centennial Remembrance of The Great Storm of 1900, and MP3 audio files are available from the official 1900 Storm Remembrance Site. This CD tells the story of the Saint Mary's Orphanage during the 1900 Storm and includes the song Queen of the Waves.

The Japan Times describes kayōkyoku as \"standard Japanese pop\" or \"Showa era pop\". Kayōkyoku is Western-style-inspired music of Japan. Music in this genre is extremely varied as a result. Kayōkyoku in the narrower and more practical sense, however, excludes J-pop and enka. Unlike \"J-pop\" singers such as Southern All Stars' Keisuke Kuwata, the singers of the kayōkyoku genre do not use stylized pronunciations based on the English language, but prefer traditional Japanese. There are exceptions, such as in singer Momoe Yamaguchi's song \"Rock 'n' Roll Widow\". Unlike enka, kayōkyoku is also not based on emotional displays of effort while singing. Famous kayōkyoku artists include Kyu Sakamoto, The Peanuts, The Tigers, Candies, Pink Lady, Seiko Matsuda, Junko Sakurada, The Checkers and Onyanko Club.",

In 1947 the collaborations of bebop innovator Dizzy Gillespie with Cuban percussionist Chano Pozo brought Afro-Cuban rhythms and instruments, most notably the tumbadora and the bongo, into the East Coast jazz scene. Early combinations of jazz with Cuban music, such as Dizzy's and Pozo's \"Manteca\" and Charlie Parker's and Machito's \"Mangó Mangüé\", were commonly referred to as \"Cubop\", short for Cuban bebop.. During its first decades, the Afro-Cuban jazz movement was stronger in the United States than in Cuba itself. In the early 1970s, the Orquesta Cubana de Música Moderna and later Irakere brought Afro-Cuban jazz into the Cuban music scene, influencing new styles such as songo.",

The opera has a modern resonance of the story’s theme of “immigration to America and the difficulty and suspicion with which newcomers are greeted.”The Garden of Martyrs musically dramatizes the last five days of the men’s lives. The protagonist is Father Jean Cheverus, a French immigrant priest who travels from Boston to Northampton to comfort the men—even though he believes them guilty. Cheverus’ journey of transformation is the heart of the opera."

      "description": "Tristan und Isolde (Tristan and Isolde, or Tristan and Isolda, or Tristran and Ysolt) is an opera, or music drama, in three acts by Richard Wagner to a German libretto by the composer, based largely on the romance by Gottfried von Strassburg. It was composed between 1857 and 1859 and premiered at the Königliches Hof- und Nationaltheater in Munich on 10 June 1865 with Hans von Bülow conducting. Wagner referred to the work not as an opera, but called it \"eine Handlung\" (literally a drama, a plot or an action), which was the equivalent of the term used by the Spanish playwright Calderón for his dramas. Wagner's composition of Tristan und Isolde was inspired by the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer (particularly The World as Will and Representation), as well as by Wagner's affair with Mathilde Wesendonck. Widely acknowledged as one of the peaks of the operatic repertoire, Tristan was notable for Wagner's unprecedented use of chromaticism, tonality, orchestral colour and harmonic suspension. The opera was enormously influential among Western classical composers and provided direct inspiration to composers such as Gustav Mahler, Richard Strauss, Karol Szymanowski, Alban Berg, Arnold Schoenberg and Benjamin Britten. Other composers like Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel and Igor Stravinsky formulated their styles in contrast to Wagner's musical legacy. Many see Tristan as the beginning of the move away from common practice harmony and tonality and consider that it lays the groundwork for the direction of classical music in the 20th century. Both Wagner's libretto style and music were also profoundly influential on the Symbolist poets of the late 19th century and early 20th century."

As a genre it blends the sound of Western musical styles such as country with that of rhythm and blues, leading to what is considered \"classic\" rock and roll. Some have also described it as a blend of the bluegrass style with rock and roll. The term \"rockabilly\" itself is a portmanteau of \"rock\" (from \"rock 'n' roll\") and \"hillbilly\", the latter a reference to the country music (often called \"hillbilly music\" in the 1940s and 1950s) that contributed strongly to the style. Other important influences on rockabilly include western swing, boogie woogie, jump blues and electric blues. Defining features of the rockabilly sound included strong rhythms, vocal twangs and common use of the tape echo, but the progressive addition of different instruments and vocal harmonies led to its \"dilution\". Initially popularized by artists such as Bill Haley, Buddy Holly, Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, Bob Luman and Jerry Lee Lewis, the influence and success of the style waned in the 1960s; nonetheless, during the late 1970s and early 1980s, rockabilly enjoyed a major revival through acts such as Stray Cats. An interest in the genre endures even in the 21st century, often within a subculture. Rockabilly has left a legacy, spawning a variety of sub-styles and influencing other genres such as punk rock.",

Similar genres include soul jazz and jazz fusion, but neither entirely overlap with jazz-funk. Notably jazz-funk is less vocal, more arranged and featured more improvisation than soul jazz, and retains a strong feel of groove and R&B versus some of the jazz fusion production.",

      "description": "Pop punk (also known as punk-pop) is a fusion music genre that combines elements of punk rock with pop music to varying degrees. The music typically combines fast punk tempos, chord changes and loud guitars with pop-influenced melodies and lyrical themes. Pop-influenced punk rock emerged in the mid-1970s with a music style that was stylistically similar to power pop. By the mid 1980s, several bands merged hardcore punk with pop music to create a new, faster pop punk sound such as Dag Nasty, the Nip Drivers, T.S.O.L., Social Distortion, and the Descendents. Pop punk in the United States began to grow in popularity locally in California in the mid to late 1980s. Pop punk particularly thrived in California, where independent record labels adopted a do it yourself (DIY) approach to releasing music. By the mid 1990s, a few pop punk bands started to sell millions of records and receive extensive radio and television airplay, such as Green Day. By 1994, pop punk was quickly growing in mainstream popularity. The late 1990s, exemplified by the 1999 release of Blink-182's Enema of the State, represented the genre's mainstream peak, although some pop punk bands scored successful album chartings in the 2000s. In the mid-2000s, emo pop, a fusion genre combining emo and pop punk, became popular. By the end of the first decade of the 21st century the pop punk sound of the 1990s had largely waned in mainstream popularity.",

Frontalot, like most nerdcore artists, self-publishes his work and has released much of it for free online. As a niche genre, nerdcore generally holds to the DIY ethic, and has a history of self-publishing and self-production. Though nerdcore rappers rhyme about anything from politics to science fiction, there are some perennial favorites in nerdcore subject matter, including Star Wars, role-playing games, science, fantasy and computers. Music with similar themes, but different musical styles can be found in the filk genres. There are hip hop artists who have recorded compositions which focus on similar topics, but who are not generally considered nerdcore (an example would be Blackalicious, a group which does not claim to be nerdcore, despite science-oriented songs like \"Chemical Calisthenics\"). Conversely, one does not need to concentrate on those topics to be nerdcore: most of the songs by Frontalot do not focus narrowly on stereotypically nerdy topics. The difference is largely one of self-identification; the group Blackalicious does not identify as \"nerds\", while Frontalot does.",

Traditionally a three-movement work, the modern-day flute concerto has occasionally been structured in four or more movements. In some flute concertos, especially from the Baroque and modern eras, the flute is accompanied by a chamber ensemble rather than an orchestra. The 20th century saw the flute concerto championed by the famous French flutist Jean-Pierre Rampal."

Their styles developed into West Coast blues, Detroit blues, and post-World War II Chicago blues, which differed from earlier, predominantly acoustic-style blues. By the early 1950s, Little Walter was a featured soloist on blues harmonica or blues harp using a small hand-held microphone fed into a guitar amplifier. Although it took a little longer, the electric bass guitar gradually replaced the stand-up bass by the early 1960s. Electric organs and especially keyboards later became widely used in electric blues.",

The story is an operatic adaptation of Gilbert's 1873 blank-verse fairy comedy, The Wicked World. In Fairyland, the fairies are curious about wicked mortals, especially their strange capacity for love. They summon three mortal men from the world below to observe them and to teach the men how to live virtuously. The fairies fall in love with the mortals, become jealous of each other and behave badly. The men return to Earth, and the fairies realize that love is overrated. The piece premiered at London's Savoy Theatre on 15 December 1909. Gilbert directed the opera. Charles Herbert Workman produced and starred as Lutin. The cast also featured Claude Flemming as Ethais, Leo Sheffield as Phyllon and Nancy McIntosh as Selene, with choreography by John D'Auban and costume designs by Percy Anderson. McIntosh received negative reviews, and Workman soon replaced her with Amy Evans and made changes in the play that angered Gilbert, who sued Workman. Despite better reviews for Evans, the work did not please the critics, or ultimately the audiences. It failed, closing after just 50 performances. Neither Gilbert nor German would write another opera."

      "description": "Dumka (Ukrainian: думка, dúmka, plural думки, dúmky) is a musical term introduced from the Ukrainian language, with cognates in other Slavic languages. The word \"dumka\" literally means \"thought\". Originally, it is the diminutive form of the Ukrainian term duma, pl. dumy, \"a Slavic (specifically Ukrainian) epic ballad … generally thoughtful or melancholic in character\". Ukrainian and other Slavic classical composers drew on the harmonic patterns in the folk music of their countries to inform their more formal classical compositions. The composition of dumky became popular after the publication of an ethnological study and analysis and a number of illustrated lectures were made by the Ukrainian composer Mykola Lysenko in 1873 and 1874 in Kiev and Saint Petersburg. The lectures and publication were illustrated by a live performances by the blind kobzar Ostap Veresai who performed a number of dumky singing to the accompaniment of his bandura. Lysenko's study was the first to specifically study the melodies and the instrumental accompaniment played on the bandura, kobza or lira of the epic dumy. A natural part of the process of transferring the traditional folk form to a formal classical milieu was the appropriation of the Dumka form by Slavic composers, most especially by Antonín Dvořák. Thus, in classical music, it came to mean \"a type of instrumental music involving sudden changes from melancholy to exuberance\". Though generally characterized by a gently plodding, dreamy duple rhythm, many examples are in triple meter, including the popular Op. 72 No. 2 by Dvořák. Dvořák's last and best-known piano trio, No. 4 in E minor, Op. 90, has six movements, each of which is a Dumka; the piece is sometimes called the Dumky-Trio."

      "description": "Trance is a genre of electronic music that developed during the 1990s in Germany. It is characterized by a tempo lying between 125 and 150 beats per minute (BPM), repeating melodic phrases, and a musical form that distinctly builds tension and elements throughout a track often culminating in 1 to 2 \"peaks\" or \"drops.\" Although trance is a genre of its own, it liberally incorporates influences from other electronic music styles such as techno, house, pop, chill-out classical music, tech house, ambient, and film music. A trance refers to a state of hypnotism and heightened consciousness. This is portrayed in trance music by the mixing of layers with distinctly foreshadowed build-up and release. A characteristic of virtually all trance music is a mid-song climax followed by a soft breakdown disposing of beats and percussion entirely, and leaving the melody and/or atmospherics to stand alone for an extended period before gradually building up again. As a result, trance tracks are often lengthy to allow for this progression and have sufficiently sparse opening and closing sections to facilitate mixing by DJs. Trance can be purely instrumental, although vocals are also a common feature. Typically they are performed by mezzo-soprano to soprano female soloists, often without verse/chorus structure. Structured vocal form in trance music forms the basis of the vocal trance subgenre, which has been described as \"grand, soaring, and operatic\" and \"ethereal female leads floating amongst the synths\".",

Blackgaze also contains metalcore & post-hardcore occasionally and the production is characterized by a clearer and more pristine sound. It also tends to feature a more positive, \"beautiful\" sound than traditional black metal, due to its much more frequent use of major-scale composition.

      "description": "Australian hip hop traces its origins to the early 1980s and is largely inspired by hip hop and other predominantly African-American musical genres from the United States. As the form matured, Australian hip hop has become a commercially viable style of music that is no longer restricted to the creative underground, with artists such as Hilltop Hoods and Bliss n Eso achieving notable fame. Australian hip-hop is still primarily released through independent record labels, which are often owned and operated by the artists themselves. Despite its genesis as an offshoot of American hip hop, Australian hip hop has developed a distinct regional personality that reflects its evolution as an Australian musical style.",

      "description": "\"Free Man In Paris\" is a song written by Canadian singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell. It appeared on her 1974 album Court and Spark, as well as her live album Shadows and Light. It is one of her most popular songs.[citation needed] The song is about music agent/promoter David Geffen, a close friend of Mitchell in the early 1970s, and describes Geffen during a trip Geffen and Mitchell made to Paris with Robbie and Dominique Robertson. \"Free Man in Paris\" went to number twenty-two on the Billboard Hot 100 and to number two on the Easy Listening chart. The home key of the song is A-major. The frequent substitution of \"flattened\" scale degrees (flat-6 and flat-7; that is, in A-major, F-natural and G-natural in place of F# and G#) adds a jazzy folky sound to the song. The time signature is 4/4 except the compound quintuple meter intro counted as 15/8 or simply 2 bars of 6/8 plus 3 eighth notes. The opening melodic lick E-F#-E-E-A (set to the words \"The way I see it\") is the fundamental source of the song's vocal line. It also foreshadows some of the dramatic chord progressions. The pattern is composed of two simple motions. The first is E-F#-E, a neighbouring-tone pattern in which the upward step to F#, and immediate return to E serve to embellish the E. The second is the upward motion from E to A in which the upward skip to A embellishes the E. Through both these simple motions, the primary melodic tone E is said to be prolonged over the entire lick. In scale step notation, these motions can be notated as 5-6-5, and 5-1.[citation needed] While Geffen is never mentioned by name, Mitchell describes how he works hard creating hits and launching careers but can find some peace while vacationing in Paris. Mitchell sings \"I was a free man in Paris. I felt unfettered and alive. Nobody calling me up for favors. No one's future to decide.\" In the 1970s, an instrumental version of the song was the theme music used for CBC Television's The Saturday Evening News, which aired at 6 p.m. till 1982 when it was replaced with Saturday Report. \"Free Man In Paris\" has been covered by Aimee Mann, Neil Diamond, Sufjan Stevens, Adrienne Young, Phish, Elton John, Alanis Morissette and JoJo who changed the title to \"White Girl in Paris\". It is ranked #470 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time."

      "description": "Nortec (from the combination of \"norteño\" and \"techno\") is a genre of electronic dance music developed in Tijuana (a border city in Baja California, Mexico) that first gained popularity in 2001. Nortec music is characterized by hard dance beats and samples from traditional forms of Mexican music such as Banda sinaloense and Norteño - unmistakably Mexican horns are often used. Different individual projects create nortec music. There is also a \"Colectivo Visual\": a group of designers and VJs who take care of the visual side of nortec live shows. The term Nortec is a conjunction of norteño (\"of\" or \"from the North\") and techno, but mainly describes the collision between the music, style and culture of electronic music with those of norteño and tambora, two music genres indigenous to the North of Mexico. These styles are characterized by their use of accordions and double bass (norteño); tubas, clarinets, horns and pumping bass drums (tambora) and quirky use of percussion and polyrhytmic snare drum rolls (both). All of these elements are used to create a sound that is very Tijuana-like. Nortec originated in 1999 when Pepe Mogt started by experimenting with samples of old banda sinaloense and norteño albums and altering them on his computer or filtering them with analog synthesizers. He had picked up on the idea by listening to the percussive and angular grooves of the tambora and norteña music played at a family social event. Through some contacts in recording studios located in Tijuana's notorious Zona Norte red light district, Pepe compiled tracks of isolated instruments from multitrack recording of tambora and norteño demo recordings that had been abandoned at the studios by the bands that recorded them. He began to burn these tracks onto CD-Rs, which he would later distribute to friends under the condition that they make a new track using the material. Those first raw tracks were compiled onto the \"Nor-tec Sampler\", the first release from Mil Records followed by the release \"The Tijuana Sessions Vol. 1\" and then \"The Tijuana Sessions Vol. 3\".",

The first and fifth movements have some minimalist elements and explore the extreme registers of the piano. The second movement starts slow and mysterious, similar to Béla Bartók's \"night music\". After a whip crack which marks a climax, the woodwind play a dissonant passage in their highest registers, accompanied by descending chromatic chords from the piano and the xylophone. The movement ends with an almost silent harmonica passage."

According to documentation at the United States Library of Congress, it is \"one of the oldest and most widely distributed tunes\" and is rated in the top ten most-played Old Time Fiddle tune. According to the Illinois Humanities Center, the tune dates as early as the 1760s. In spite of its upbeat tempo and catchy melody, the term \"soldier's joy\" has a much darker meaning than is portrayed by the tune. This term eventually came to refer to the combination of whiskey, beer, and morphine used by Civil War soldiers.",

Set on an unnamed island in the West Indies, the opera tells the story of African American Brutus Jones, a former Pullman porter and ex-convict who escaped to the island, set himself up as its tyrannical \"Emperor\", and became rich by exploiting the natives. The natives start a revolt against him, and as he tries to escape through the jungle, he is haunted by visions of his past life and the man he had murdered. As the natives close in, he commits suicide using the silver bullet which he had worn around his neck as a good-luck charm. With a score that incorporates elements of jazz and negro spirituals, The Emperor Jones was the eleventh American opera to premiere at the Met, and has continued to be performed into the 21st century, albeit rarely."

      "description": "Barbershop vocal harmony, as codified during the barbershop revival era (1930s–present), is a style of a cappella close harmony, or unaccompanied vocal music, characterized by consonant four-part chords for every melody note in a predominantly homophonic texture. Each of the four parts has its own role: generally, the lead sings the melody, the tenor harmonizes above the melody, the bass sings the lowest harmonizing notes, and the baritone completes the chord, usually below the lead. The melody is not usually sung by the tenor or baritone, except for an infrequent note or two to avoid awkward voice leading, in tags or codas, or when some appropriate embellishment can be created. Occasional passages may be sung by fewer than four voice parts. Barbershop music is generally performed by either a barbershop quartet, a group of four singers with one on each vocal part, or a barbershop chorus, which closely resembles a choir with the notable exception of the genre of music. Female barbershop quartets are often referred to as \"Sweet Adelines quartets\", while male barbershop quartets are generally simply referred to as \"Barbershop quartets\". According to the Barbershop Harmony Society (BHS), \"Barbershop music features songs with understandable lyrics and easily singable melodies, whose tones clearly define a tonal center and imply major and minor chords and barbershop (dominant and secondary dominant) seventh chords that resolve primarily around the circle of fifths, while making frequent use of other resolutions.\" Slower barbershop songs, especially ballads, often eschew a continuous beat, and notes are often held (or sped up) ad libitum. Except for the bass, the voice parts in barbershop singing do not correspond closely to their classical music counterparts; the tenor range and tessitura are similar to those of the classical countertenor, the baritone resembles the Heldentenor or lyric baritone in range and a tenor in tessitura, and the lead generally corresponds to the tenor of classical repertoire, with some singers possessing a tessitura more similar to that of a high baritone. Barbershop singing is performed both by men's and women's groups; the elements of the barbershop style and the names of the voice parts are the same for both (although women's groups generally have a different standing arrangement than their male counterparts)."

      "description": "Shoegazing (also known as shoegaze) is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged from the United Kingdom in the late 1980s and reached peak popularity in the early 1990s. The style is typified by significant use of guitar distortion, feedback, obscured vocals and the blurring of component musical parts into indistinguishable \"walls of sound\". The term \"shoegazing\" was initially devised by the British music press as a gibe meant to ridicule the stage presence of a wave of groups who stood still during live performances in a detached, introspective, non-confrontational state, often with their heads down; the heavy use of effects pedals also contributed to the image of performers looking down at their feet during concerts. The term was often used contemporaneously with \"dream pop.\" A loose label given to the shoegazing scene and other affiliated bands in London in the early 1990s was The Scene That Celebrates Itself. In the early 1990s, shoegazing groups were pushed aside by the American grunge movement and early Britpop acts such as Suede, forcing the relatively unknown bands to break up or reinvent their style altogether. In the 2000s, there was renewed interest in the genre among \"nu gaze\" bands.",

      "description": "Bozlak is a form of Turkish folk song from Central Anatolia accompanied by the long-necked saz (bozuk saz) and ney or kaval. The main subjects of the melancholic songs are separation and love. The songs begin with a very high pitched vocal and end in a low vocal. The best known players are Tufan Altaş, Aşık Hüseyin, Muharrem Ertaş, Neşet Ertaş, Mustafa Tatlıtürk, Çekiç Ali, Hacı Taşan, and Bedia Akartürk. Bozlak, which is a form of uzun hava (long tune) in Turkish Folk Music, has been a form of music starting from Central Anatolia and an expression of the cultures of the Yoruk / Turkmen and Avshar tribes which pursue a way of life based on yaylak (summer highland pasture)- and kislak (winter pasture). In terms of meaning, the word ‘bozlak’ has the meanings of to shout, to yell, to cry out, and to burst out. The bursting out of the sorrow, desolation and the outbreak that the Turkmens and Avshars experienced in daily life to the nature caused the emergence of the bozlak culture. Turkmens, Avshars and the Abdals who existed among these tribes have transferred the tradition of bozlak to our day. The term ‘bozlak’ means to scream, to revolt; ‘to struggle’ and with this frame this term is used to deal with social concepts such as death, separate, and pain, and it is seen in the several parts of the country especially in the Middle Anatolia and Çukurova region, and two different style; ‘Avshar style’ and ‘Turkmen style’ is used in ‘bozlak’ thus, using two different makam (tones) proves that it cannot be explained only through ‘Kürdi’ style."

      "description": "Brich dem Hungrigen dein Brot (Break your bread for the hungry), BWV 39, is a church cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach. He composed it in Leipzig and first performed it on 23 June 1726, the first Sunday after Trinity. About three years earlier, on the first Sunday after Trinity of 1723, Bach had taken office as Thomaskantor and started his first cycle of cantatas for the occasions of the liturgical year, and on the first Sunday after Trinity 1724 he began his second cycle, consisting of chorale cantatas. As he composed no new work for the first Sunday after Trinity 1725, Brich dem Hungrigen dein Brot is regarded as part of his third cantata cycle. The text is from a 1704 collection attributed to Duke Ernst Ludwig von Sachsen-Meiningen. The symmetrical structure of seven movements is typical for this collection, beginning with a quotation from the Old Testament, culminating in a central quotation from the New Testament and ending with a chorale. The theme is an invocation to be grateful for God's gifts and to share them with the needy. Bach set the opening movement as a complex choral structure, but the central movement as a simple solo for the bass voice, traditionally considered the voice of Jesus. The instrumentation is for woodwinds and strings, including recorders as a symbol of poverty, need and humility. It is possibly the last time that Bach scored recorders in his cantatas."

Queercore expresses itself in a DIY style through zines, music, writing, art and film. As a musical genre, it may be distinguished by lyrics exploring themes of prejudice and dealing with issues such as sexual identity, gender identity and the rights of the individual; more generally bands offer a critique of society endemic to their position within it, sometimes in a light-hearted way, sometimes seriously. Musically, many queercore bands originated in the punk scene but the industrial music culture has been influential as well. Queercore groups encompass many genres such as hardcore punk, electropunk, indie rock, power pop, No Wave, noise, experimental, industrial and others.",

This type of music is heard on both sides of the US–Mexican border. Besides from being heard in Mexico, it is widely heard and produced throughout all Latin America. It uses a danceable, accordion-based polka as a rhythmic base. The first corridos that focus on drug smugglers—the narco comes from \"narcotics\"—have been dated by Juan Ramírez-Pimienta to the 1930s. Early corridos (non-narco) go back as far to the Mexican Revolution of 1910, telling the stories of revolutionary fighters. Music critics have also compared narcocorrido lyrics and style to gangster rap and mafioso rap. Narcocorrido lyrics refer to particular events and include real dates and places. The lyrics tend to speak approvingly of illegal activities, mainly drug trafficking.",

Bach composed the cantata in his second year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig as part of cantata cycle of chorale cantatas, for the second Sunday after Epiphany. The work is based on a hymn without evident connection to the prescribed readings. It is a meditation on Jesus as a comforter in distress, based on a medieval model. An unknown librettist reworked the ideas of the 18 stanzas in six movements, retaining the words of stanzas 1, 2 and 18 as movements 1, 2 and 6. Similarly, Bach retained the choral melody in three movements, set as a chorale fantasia in the opening chorus with the bass singing the cantus firmus, as a four-part setting with interspersed recitatives in the second movement, and in the closing chorale. He scored the cantata for two oboes d'amore, strings and continuo, with an added trobone to support the bass in the first movement, and a horn to support the soprano in the last movement."

The basis for the rhythm was born in Jamaica while the rhythm was perfected and the lyrical content and mastery was created in Panama, although it achieved a greater worldwide popularity from artists from Puerto Rico. After its mainstream exposure in 2004, it spread to North American, European, Asian and African audiences. Reggaeton blends musical influences of Jamaican dancehall and Trinidadian soca with those of Puerto Rico, such as salsa, bomba, Latin American hip hop, and electronica. Vocals include rapping and singing, typically in Spanish. Lyrics tend to be in a hip hop style. While it takes influences from hip hop and Jamaican dancehall, reggaeton is not precisely the Hispanic or Latin American version of either of these genres; reggaeton has its own specific beat and rhythm, whereas Latin hip hop is simply hip hop recorded by artists of Latino descent. The specific \"riddim\" that characterizes reggaeton is referred to as \"Dembow\". The name \"Dembow\" is taken from the dancehall song by Shabba Ranks that first popularized the beat in the early 1990s, and appears on his album Just Reality.",

      "description": "Viking metal is a style of heavy metal music with origins in black metal and Nordic folk music, characterized by a common lyrical and thematic focus on Norse mythology, Norse paganism, and the Viking Age. Viking metal is quite diverse as a musical style, to the point where some scholars consider it more of a term than a genre, but it is typically manifested as black metal with influences from Nordic folk music. Some common traits include a slow-paced and heavy riffing style, anthemic choruses, use of both clean and harsh vocals, a frequent reliance on folk instrumentation, and often the use of keyboards for atmospheric effect. Viking metal developed in the 1980s through the mid-1990s as a rejection of Satanism and the occult, instead embracing the Vikings and paganism as the leaders of opposition to Christianity. It is similar, in lyrics, sound, and thematic imagery, to pagan metal, but pagan metal has a broader mythological focus and utilizes folk instrumentation more extensively. Most Viking metal bands originate from the Nordic countries, and nearly all bands claim that their members descend, directly or indirectly, from Vikings. Many scholars view Viking metal and the related black, pagan, and folk metal genres as part of broader neopaganism and neo-völkisch movements as well as part of a global movement of renewed interest in, and celebration of, local and regional ethnicities. Though artists such as Led Zeppelin, Yngwie Malmsteen, Heavy Load, and Manowar have previously dealt with Viking themes, Bathory, from Sweden, is generally credited with pioneering the style with its albums Blood Fire Death (1988) and Hammerheart (1990), which launched a renewed interest in the Viking Age among heavy metal musicians. Enslaved, from Norway, followed up on this burgeoning Viking trend with Hordanes Land (1993) and Vikingligr Veldi (1994). Burzum, Emperor, Einherjer, and Helheim, among others, helped further develop the genre in the early through mid-1990s. Through the work of artists such as the German project Falkenbach, Viking metal soon spread from the Nordic countries to other nations with Viking history or an even broader Germanic heritage, and has since influenced musicians across the globe. The death metal bands Unleashed and Amon Amarth, which emerged during the early 1990s, also adopted Viking themes, broadening the style from its primarily black metal origin.",

      "description": "The Symphony No. 5 by Arnold Bax was completed in 1932 and dedicated to Jean Sibelius. It is in many ways heavily influenced by Sibelius. It is scored for two piccolos, three flutes, two oboes, English horn, three clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, double bassoon, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, bass drum, tenor drum, snare drum, tambourine, cymbals, gong, glockenspiel, harp and strings. It is in three movements: It opens with a five-note motif that is used throughout the entire poco lento section, which is heavily reminiscent of Sibelius's Symphony No. 4. The allegro con fuoco section that follows however is highly Baxian, and all the features of his composition style are evident here. The second subject sees the return of Sibelian moods, but Bax's comprehensive musical technique is noticeable. The recapitulation is particularly exciting, making it one of the most energetic opening movements of all Bax's symphonies. The second movement is majestic and a relatively short slow movement for Bax, but makes good use of brass and the percussion section. It ends calmly as to ensure a contrast between this movement and the one that follows. The finale begins with strong, repeated chords from the strings and woodwinds which quickly give way to a fast, fiery and energetic allegro section in which the influences of Russian composers is evident. Unlike in the previous symphonies, the epilogue is bold and majestic."

In the past, it was traditional for parang serenaders to pay nocturnal visits to the homes of family and friends, where part of the fun was waking the inhabitants of the household from their beds. Today, parang is especially vibrant in Trinidad and Tobago communities such as Paramin, Lopinot, and Arima. A new form of parang, soca parang, has emerged.

The libretto was written by Nicolas-François Guillard. With Iphigénie, Gluck took his operatic reform to its logical conclusion. The recitatives are shorter and they are récitatif accompagné (i.e. the strings and perhaps other instruments are playing, not just continuo accompaniment). The normal dance movements that one finds in the French tragédie en musique are almost entirely absent. The drama is ultimately based on the play Iphigenia in Tauris by the ancient Greek dramatist Euripides which deals with stories concerning the family of Agamemnon in the aftermath of the Trojan War."

It was one of several works commissioned from different composers by the Japanese government to mark the 2,600th anniversary of the founding of the Japanese Empire (taken to be 11 February 660 BCE). The Japanese government rejected the Sinfonia for its use of Latin titles from the Catholic Requiem for its three movements and for its somber overall character, but it was received positively at its world premiere in New York City under John Barbirolli. A performance in Boston under Serge Koussevitzky led to the commission of the opera Peter Grimes from the Koussevitzky Music Foundations. The Sinfonia is Britten's largest purely orchestral work for the concert hall. It was his first major orchestral work that did not include a soloist and, according to musicologist Peter Evans, marks the peak of his early writing in this idiom. Unlike many of Britten's works from this time, it has remained popular and continues to be programmed on orchestral concerts."

The following two were composed less than a decade later and involve more expressive dynamic markings and contrasts. The final two sonatas, written nearly thirty years after the Fourth Sonata, are perhaps the most shocking and violent expressions within her musical output."

      "description": "Ragtime – also spelled rag-time or rag time – is a musical genre that enjoyed its peak popularity between 1895 and 1918. Its cardinal trait is its syncopated, or \"ragged\", rhythm. The genre has its origins in African-American communities like St. Louis years before being published as popular sheet music for piano. Ernest Hogan (1865–1909) was a pioneer of ragtime music and the first to publish in the musical genre. He is also credited for coining the term ragtime. Ben Harney, a white Kentucky native has often been credited for introducing the music to the mainstream public. His ragtime compositions helped popularize the genre throughout America. Ragtime was also a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music. The ragtime composer Scott Joplin (ca. 1868–1917) became famous through the publication of the \"Maple Leaf Rag\" (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as \"The Entertainer\" (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s. For at least 12 years after its publication, \"Maple Leaf Rag\" heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, harmonic progressions or metric patterns. Ragtime fell out of favor as jazz claimed the public's imagination after 1917, but there have been numerous revivals since the music has been re-discovered. First in the early 1940s, many jazz bands began to include ragtime in their repertoire and put out ragtime recordings on 78 rpm records. A more significant revival occurred in the 1950s as a wider variety of ragtime styles of the past were made available on records, and new rags were composed, published, and recorded. In 1971 Joshua Rifkin brought out a compilation of Joplin's work which was nominated for a Grammy Award. In 1973 The New England Ragtime Ensemble (then a student group called The New England Conservatory Ragtime Ensemble) recorded The Red Back Book, a compilation of some of Joplin's rags in period orchestrations edited by conservatory president Gunther Schuller. This also won a Grammy for Best Chamber Music Performance of the year and was named Billboard's Top Classical Album of 1974. Subsequently, the motion picture The Sting (1973) brought ragtime to a wide audience with its soundtrack of Joplin tunes. The film's rendering of \"The Entertainer\", adapted and orchestrated by Marvin Hamlisch, was a Top 5 hit in 1974. Ragtime – with Joplin's work at the forefront – has been cited as an American equivalent of the minuets of Mozart, the mazurkas of Chopin, or the waltzes of Brahms. Ragtime also influenced classical composers including Erik Satie, Claude Debussy and Igor Stravinsky.",

It has been named for two of its central characters, the knight Huon and the fairy king Oberon, respectively. The opera was published in \"Flensburg, Schleswig and Leipzig\" in 1789, the year Seyler died. Seyler was married to the prominent theatre director Abel Seyler, the founder of the Seyler Theatre Company and a noted promoter of both German opera and William Shakespeare. The opera was dedicated to their common long-time friend and collaborator, the actor Friedrich Ludwig Schröder. Seyler's opera and a plagiarized version by Karl Ludwig Giesecke both enjoyed popularity from the late 18th century. The opera was also an important influence on the libretto of The Magic Flute."

      "description": "Minimal music is a form of art music that employs limited or minimal musical materials. In the Western art music tradition the American composers La Monte Young, Terry Riley, Steve Reich, and Philip Glass are credited with being among the first to develop compositional techniques that exploit a minimal approach. It originated in the New York Downtown scene of the 1960s and was initially viewed as a form of experimental music called the New York Hypnotic School. As an aesthetic, it is marked by a non-narrative, non-teleological, and non-representational conception of a work in progress, and represents a new approach to the activity of listening to music by focusing on the internal processes of the music, which lack goals or motion toward those goals. Prominent features of the technique include consonant harmony, steady pulse (if not immobile drones), stasis or gradual transformation, and often reiteration of musical phrases or smaller units such as figures, motifs, and cells. It may include features such as additive process and phase shifting which leads to what has been termed phase music. Minimal compositions that rely heavily on process techniques that follow strict rules are usually described using the term process music. The movement originally involved dozens of composers, although only five (Young, Riley, Reich, Glass, and later John Adams) emerged to become publicly associated with American minimal music. In Europe, the music of Louis Andriessen, Karel Goeyvaerts, Michael Nyman, Howard Skempton, Gavin Bryars, Steve Martland, Henryk Górecki, Arvo Pärt and John Tavener exhibits minimalist traits. It is unclear where the term minimal music originates. Steve Reich has suggested that it is attributable to Michael Nyman, a claim two scholars, Jonathan Bernard and Dan Warburton, have also made in writing. Philip Glass believes Tom Johnson coined the phrase.",

      "description": "\"Glory to God\" is a Christmas carol popular among American and Canadian Reformed churches that have Dutch roots. It is translated from the Dutch \"Ere Zij God\" and is one of the most beloved carols sung in Protestant churches in the Netherlands. Whether the original text is the Dutch \"Ere Zij God\" or the German \"Ehre sei Gott\", the lyrics are inspired by the words that the angels sang when the birth of Christ was announced to shepherds in Luke 2:14. The song first appeared in print in 1857 in the hymnal Het nachtegaaltje (The little nightingale), compiled and written by lyricist Isaac Bikkers (1833-1903). The hymn is thus one of a series that have drawn on that text, including Angels We Have Heard on High, Angels from the Realms of Glory, While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks, and, by far the most ancient, the Greater Doxology or Gloria in Excelsis Deo. The music is attributed to F.A. Schultz, of whom little is known except for references by others that a Franz Albert Schultz wrote a song book while working at a college in Königsberg in 1731. No copies of this book are extant. Dutch song books indicate the composition date as 1870. The music is grandiose in style, in the A-B-A form, with an extended, flowing double-Amen ending."

The bands cited by the magazine included Sheffield guitar-based groups Milburn, Harrisons, Bromheads Jacket, and The Long Blondes, and Leeds bands The Pigeon Detectives, Your Vegas, The Research, and Black Wire. NME identified new crossover genres developing in Leeds, which it described as \"disco-punk\" and \"dance-metal\". ¡Forward, Russia!, and The Sunshine Underground are examples of this. Other bands that fall into this genre include Stable, O Fracas, The Defunct, Dead Disco, Stoney, This Et Al, The Ivories, Monkey Swallows the Universe, Tiny Dancers, Little Man Tate, Bhuna, Solar Powered Butterflies, Reverend and The Makers, Duels, Little Ze, Letters and Colours, The Yell, Smokers Die Younger, Champion Kickboxer, and One Night Only (from Ryedale, North Yorkshire). Another new genre developing in Leeds is that of 'Surf Pop', which is typified by Buen Chico. Various Yorkshire-based record labels have worked on DIY releases around the same time, including The Laundrette, Thee Sheffield Phonographic Corporation, and Spoonjuice Records. The Leeds label Dance to the radio was formed by ¡Forward, Russia!, and its February 2006 release \"What We All Want\", showcases a number of New Yorkshire bands, including The Playmates, The Lodger, Bam Bam Francs and Voltage Union. The movement was in its prime between 2005—2008, where a number of the artists reached national recognition and were successful in the UK charts. However, many disbanded in the following years as they failed to achieve the long-term success seen by some of the more notable acts, with few bands from the region appearing in music charts in the late 2000s and early 2010s."

      "description": "Gangsta rap or gangster rap is a subgenre of hip hop music with themes and lyrics based on the \"thug\" or \"gangsta\" lifestyle. The genre evolved from hardcore hip hop into a distinct form, pioneered in the mid-1980s by rappers such as Schoolly D and Ice-T, and was popularized in the later part of the 1980s by groups like N.W.A. After the national attention that Ice-T and N.W.A attracted in the late 1980s and early 1990s, gangsta rap became the most commercially lucrative subgenre of hip hop. Many (if not most) gangsta rap artists openly boast of their associations with various active street gangs as part of their artistic image, with the Bloods and Crips being the most commonly represented. Gangsta rap is closely related to other indigenous gang and crime-oriented forms of music, such as the narcocorrido genre of northern Mexico. The subject matter inherent in gangsta rap has caused a great deal of controversy. Criticism has come from both left wing and right wing commentators, as well as religious leaders, who have accused the genre of promoting crime, serial killing, murder, violence, profanity, sex addiction, homophobia, racism, promiscuity, misogyny, rape, street gangs, disorderly conduct, drive-by shootings, vandalism, thievery, driving under the influence, drug dealing, alcohol abuse, substance abuse, disregarding law enforcement, materialism, and narcissism. The White House administrations of both George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton criticized the genre. \"Many black rappers--including Ice-T and Sister Souljah--contend that they are being unfairly singled out because their music reflects deep changes in society not being addressed anywhere else in the public forum. The white politicians, the artists complain, neither understand the music nor desire to hear what's going on in the devastated communities that gave birth to the art form,\" wrote journalist Chuck Philips in a review of the battle between \"the Establishment\" and defenders of rap music. \"The reason why rap is under attack is because it exposes all the contradictions of American culture ...What started out as an underground art form has become a vehicle to expose a lot of critical issues that are not usually discussed in American politics. The problem here is that the White House and wanna-bes like Bill Clinton represent a political system that never intends to deal with inner city urban chaos,\" Sister Souljah told Philips. On the other hand, some commentators (for example, Spike Lee in his satirical film Bamboozled) have criticized gangsta rap as analogous to black minstrel shows and blackface performance, in which performers – both black and white – were made to look African American, and acted in a stereotypical uncultured and ignorant manner for entertainment. Gangsta rappers often defend themselves by arguing they are describing the reality of inner-city life, and that they are only adopting a character which behaves in ways they do not necessarily endorse. Gangsta rappers are also famous (or infamous) for appearing more hardcore compared to early concepts and themes of hip-hop artists, and are known for saying things that are often considered taboo; for instance, the gangsta rap group N.W.A produced the famous Fuck tha Police protest song about police brutality and racial profiling. In high-crime areas putting on these made up personas is life-threatening, but the fact that gangsta rappers told the stories of others is often seen as having earned them respect for raising awareness of the severity of inner-city crime. Many gangsta rappers argue that in the world of their genre exists the emotions and perspectives of a people whose suffering is too often overlooked and belittled by society. Gangsta rap, in fact, was an effect of the various wrongdoings perpetrated against African-Americans in underprivileged neighborhoods. The various riots sparked by the Rodney King beating and the acquittal of the police officers responsible for the beating sparked anger and outrage in an area that was already on the bubble. Gangsta rap acted as an outlet so such people could express themselves angrily and not in fear that they were going to be silenced for telling the truth. They often used gangsta rap to tell the stories of their lives, which sometimes included strong violence, hypersexuality, and drug abuse.",

The witch house visual aesthetic includes occult, witchcraft, shamanism and horror-inspired artworks, collages and photographs as well as significant use of typographic elements such as Unicode symbols. Many works by witch house visual artists incorporate themes from horror films such as The Blair Witch Project, the television series Twin Peaks, and mainstream pop culture celebrities. Common typographic elements in artist and track names include triangles, crosses, and other Unicode symbols, which are seen by some as a method of keeping the scene underground and harder to search for on the Internet as well as references to the television series Twin Peaks and Charmed.",

It was first performed at the Opéra-Comique in Paris on 30 November 1872.It was the first full-length opera by Massenet to be produced, the one-act La grand'tante having been mounted five years earlier by the same company. Don César de Bazan was not a success and it would be another five years, with the premiere of Le roi de Lahore in 1877, before Massenet rose to his place among the most prominent composers of his time. Don César de Bazan was initially performed 13 times at the Opéra-Comique. After the fire at the Salle Favart when the parts were lost, Massenet constructed a new version from the vocal score, and this was performed in Geneva in 1888, then Antwerp, Brussels, the French provinces and the Gaîté-Lyrique in 1912, and the Hague in 1925. The work contains one piece that is performed separately with any frequency, the Sevillana for coloratura soprano."

The piece is called \"heroic\" because of the martial rhythms and fanfares of the first movement. Such touches were common to the era and were sometimes erroneously taken to suggest Rodrigo's support of Francisco Franco. A modified version of the concerto, produced for Joaquín Achúcarro, was first performed in 1999; this removed two virtuosic cadenzas and balanced the relationship between the piano and orchestral parts."

This internal struggle prompts \"Hellfire\", which has been described as \"one of the best Disney villain songs of all time\". Frollo \"confronts his lusting for Esmeralda, blaming her for turning towards darkness, and pleading to be saved\". He sings \"destroy Esmeralda, and let her taste the fires of hell, or else let her be mine and mine alone\" while the image of Esmeralda \"provocatively danc[es] in front of him\". This \"scene of lust and longing\" that the song is centered on received much press coverage at the time of the film's release, along with the alterations made to give the film a PG rating."

The genre is primarily guitar-based music, with rare characteristic blend of horns and vocal rhythms. Igbo highlife lyrics are sung mostly in Igbo with occasional infusion of Pidgin English. One of the most influential composers and performers of the music is Chief Stephen Osita Osadebe whose career spanned over 40 years. Osadebe's discography comprises numerous popular songs including the 1984 hit \"Osondi Owendi\" which launched him on the world stage as a pioneer of the Igbo highlife genre. Singer guitarist Oliver De Coque is considered \"one of the prime exemplars of and chief innovators in contemporary Igbo popular music.\" Coque was responsible for the increasing popularity of Igbo highlife with a style influenced by Congolese guitar flavor. Among his best known hits are \"Biri Ka Mbiri\", \"Ana Enwe Obodo Enwe\", \"Nnukwu Mmanwu\" and \"Identity\", all of which were largely successful throughout the 80s. Other early performers in the genre who have made significant contributions to its development are, Bright Chimezie, Sir Warrior, Celestine Ukwu, Nico Mbarga, Oriental Brothers, Ikem Mazeli.",

      "description": "\"Greenland Whale Fisheries\" is a traditional sea song. In most of the versions collected from oral sources, the song opens up giving a date for the events that it describes (usually between 1823 and 1853). However, the song is actually older than this and a form of it was published as a ballad before 1725. The song tells of a whaling expedition that leaves for Greenland. The lookout spots a \"whalefish\", and harpoon boats are launched. However, the whale strikes the boat with its tail, capsizing it, and several men are killed. The captain grieves over losing his prey, but especially for having lost his men. He then orders the ship to sail for home, calling Greenland a \"dreadful place.\" Like most traditional songs, \"Greenland Whale Fisheries\" exists in different versions. Some change details (such as the date of the expedition), and others add or remove verses. Some modern versions, including the ones recorded by Theodore Bikel, The Chad Mitchell Trio, and later by The Pogues, flip the captain's expression of grief to make him regret losing his catch even more than losing his crew. In the version popularized by The Weavers and Peter, Paul and Mary, a shanty recorded by Alan Lomax from a Barbadian fisherman is appended, which begins, \"When the whale gets strike, and the line run down, and the whale makes a flounder with her tail...\" Folk singer Paul Kaplan recorded a song with the same tune under the title \"Call Me the Whale.\" Following a similar chronology, it tells the story from the whales perspective. Covered by The Dubliners on their 1969 album At Home with The Dubliners. Covered by Ryan's Fancy on their 1971 album Dark Island. The Greenland Whalefishers, a Celtic punk band from Norway, is named after the song."

      "description": "Le Déluge (The Flood), Op. 45, is a French oratorio written by Camille Saint-Saëns in 1875 and scored for orchestra, chorus, and soloists. The libretto, a \"poème biblique\" by Louis Gallet, is based on the biblical story of Noah and the flood. It was premiered at the Théâtre du Châtelet on March 5, 1876, under the direction of Edouard Colonne. Stylistically, the work shows the influence of Berlioz and Wagner in its musical illustrations of the narrative and use of recurring motifs. It also displays Saint-Saëns's strong predilection for counterpoint; there are three fugues incorporated into the music. The work is divided into three parts and a prelude: The prelude is scored for strings only and contains a passage for solo violin. Part I describes the sinfulness of man and God's decision to destroy the world (\"J'exterminerai cette race\"). Part II is a long crescendo and decrescendo depicting the rain and rising waters of the flood. Part III evokes the flights of the dove and ends with God's promise not to curse the earth (\"Je ne maudirai plus la terre\") and a choral fugue (\"Croissez donc et multipliez\"). Although Le Déluge is sometimes listed among Saint-Saëns' best compositions, it is rarely performed today. The prelude is sometimes extracted as a concert piece."

The term \"Vespers\" (evening prayers) is taken from the Hours of the Divine Office, a set of daily prayers of the Catholic Church which have remained structurally unchanged for 1500 years. In scale, Monteverdi's Vespers was the most ambitious work of religious music before Bach. This 90-minute piece includes soloists, chorus, and orchestra and has both liturgical and extra-liturgical elements. Vespers is composed around several Biblical texts that are traditionally used as part of the liturgy for several Marian feasts in the Roman Catholic church: the introductory Deus in adjutorium (Psalm 69), five Psalm settings, sacred motets (called “concerti”) between the Psalms, a traditional Hymn, a setting of the Magnificat text and the concluding Benedicamus Domino."

      "description": "Intelligent dance music (IDM) is a genre of electronic music that emerged in the early 1990s. Its creation was influenced by developments in underground dance music such as Detroit techno and various breakbeat styles that were emerging in the UK at that time. Stylistically, IDM tended to rely upon individualistic experimentation rather than adhering to musical characteristics associated with specific genres of dance music. The range of post-techno styles to emerge in the early 1990s were described variously as \"art techno\", \"ambient techno\", \"intelligent techno\", and \"electronica\". In the United States, the latter is often used as a catchall term to describe not only downtempo or downbeat/non-dance electronic music but also electronic dance music (EDM). The term \"IDM\" is said to have originated in the United States in 1993 with the formation of the \"IDM list\", an electronic mailing list originally chartered for the discussion of music by a number of prominent English artists, especially those appearing on a 1992 Warp Records compilation called Artificial Intelligence. Usage of the term \"intelligent dance music\" has been criticised by electronic musicians such as Aphex Twin as derogatory towards other styles and is seen by artists such as Mike Paradinas as being particular to the U.S. In 2014, music critic Sasha Frere-Jones observed that the term \"is widely reviled but still commonly used\". He regards UK acts Aphex Twin and Autechre as central to the evolution of the genre.",

      "description": "Chill-out music (sometimes also chillout, chill out or simply chill) is a genre of electronic music and an umbrella term for several styles of electronic music characterized by their mellow style and mid-tempo beats, \"chill\" being derived from a slang word for \"relax\". Chill-out music emerged in the early and mid-1990s in \"chill rooms\" at dance clubs, where relaxing music was played to allow dancers a chance to \"chill out\" from the more emphatic and fast-tempo music played on the main dance floor. According to listeners of BBC Radio Scotland’s request show Get It On, the ultimate chill-out tune is \"It's All About You\" by McFly. The genres associated with chill-out are mostly ambient, trip hop, nu jazz, ambient house and other subgenres of downtempo. Sometimes, the easy listening subgenre lounge is considered to belong to the chill-out collection as well. Chill-out, as a musical genre or description, is synonymous with the more recently popularized terms \"smooth electronica\" and \"soft techno\", and it is a loose genre of music blurring into several other very distinct styles of electronic and lo-fi music.",

The genre regained attention in the late 1980s and early 1990s with the rise of alternative rock bands such as such as Failure, Hum, Flying Saucer Attack, Orange Goblin, and Spacemen 3, that drew from earlier psychedelic and shoegaze influences to create a more ambient sound, with some also being influenced by contemporaneous stoner rock or desert rock bands. The term was revived in the 21st century to refer to a new crop of bands including The Flowers of Hell, Comets on Fire, Flotation Toy Warning, Caelum's Edge and Angels and Airwaves who diversely draw upon the ideas and sounds of both waves of the genre's founders.",

The Hague was the country's beat capital, along with neighbouring coastal town Scheveningen.

The subgenre experienced mainstream success from the time of its development to the late 1970s, before its succession by disco and quiet storm. Smooth soul is characterized by melodic hooks, funk influence and smooth production style. Allmusic describes smooth soul as \"smooth, stylish, and romantic.\" Unlike pop-soul, which predominantly featured dance-oriented music at the time, smooth soul was more ballad-oriented with generally romantic and seductive lyrical themes. However, its melodic hooks were ideal for crossover play, much like the former. The funk influence of smooth soul's beats also gave the subgenre its distinction from pop. The music enjoyed commercial success during the early to mid-1970s through the works of such artists as Al Green, The Spinners, Marvin Gaye, Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes, Bill Withers, Minnie Riperton, Earth, Wind & Fire and The Stylistics. Well-known works of the smooth soul genre include Let's Get It On (1973), Spinners (1972), Just as I Am (1971) and Let's Stay Together (1972). As pop-soul had metamorphosed into disco during the late 1970s, smooth soul was eventually followed by the development of the quiet storm format.",

It is a subcultural movement that combines feminist consciousness and punk style and politics. It is often associated with third-wave feminism, which is sometimes seen as its starting point. It has also been described as a musical genre that came out of indie rock, with the punk scene serving as an inspiration for a musical movement in which women could express themselves in the same way men had been doing for the past several years. Riot grrrl bands often address issues such as rape, domestic abuse, sexuality, racism, patriarchy, and female empowerment. Primary bands associated with the movement include Bikini Kill, Bratmobile, Heavens to Betsy, Excuse 17, Huggy Bear, Skinned Teen, Emily's Sassy Lime and Sleater-Kinney, as well as queercore groups like Team Dresch and The Third Sex. In addition to a music scene and genre, riot grrrl is a subculture involving a DIY ethic, zines, art, political action, and activism. The Riot grrrl movement quickly spread well beyond its musical roots to create vibrant “zine” and World Wide Web-based movement, complete with local meetings and grassroots organizing to end ageism, homophobia, racism, sexism and, especially, physical and emotional violence against women and girls. Riot grrrls are known to hold meetings, start chapters, and support and organize women in music.",

      "description": "Techno is a form of electronic dance music that emerged in Detroit, Michigan, in the United States during the mid-to-late 1980s. The first recorded use of the word techno in reference to a specific genre of music was in 1988. Many styles of techno now exist, but Detroit techno is seen as the foundation upon which a number of subgenres have been built. In Detroit techno resulted from the melding of African American music including Chicago house, funk, electro, and electric jazz with electronic music by artists such as KevDog Kraftwerk, Giorgio Moroder, and Yellow Magic Orchestra. Added to this is the influence of futuristic and fictional themes relevant to life in American late capitalist society, with Alvin Toffler's book The Third Wave being a notable point of reference. Pioneering producer Juan Atkins cites Toffler's phrase \"techno rebels\" as inspiring him to use the word techno to describe the musical style he helped to create. Stylistically, techno is generally repetitive instrumental music, oftentimes produced for use in a continuous DJ set. The central rhythmic component is most often in common time (4/4), where time is marked with a bass drum on each quarter note pulse, a backbeat played by snare or clap on the second and fourth pulses of the bar, and an open hi-hat sounding every second eighth note. The tempo tends to vary between approximately 120 to 150 beats per minute (bpm), depending on the style of techno. The creative use of music production technology, such as drum machines, synthesizers, and digital audio workstations, is viewed as an important aspect of the music's aesthetic. Many producers use retro electronic musical devices to create what they consider to be an authentic techno sound. Drum machines from the 1980s such as Roland's TR-808 and TR-909 are highly prized, and software emulations of such retro technology are popular among techno producers. Music journalists and fans of techno are generally selective in their use of the term; so a clear distinction can be made between sometimes related but often qualitatively different styles, such as tech house and trance. .",

Musically, the rhythms have been typically those of hip hop rather than jazz, over which are placed repetitive phrases of jazz instrumentation: trumpet, double bass, etc. Lyrics are often based on political consciousness, Afrocentrism, and general positivism.

The libretto by Felice Romani was a reworking of the story of Romeo and Juliet for an opera by Nicola Vaccai called Giulietta e Romeo and based on the play of the same name by Luigi Scevola written in 1818, thus an Italian source rather than taken directly from William Shakespeare. Behind the libretto stand many Italian, ultimately Renaissance sources created by Matteo Bandello, and probably through their French translations by François de Belleforest and Pierre Boaistuau, rather than Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet. The theme was very popular in Italy: there were earlier libretti by Luzzi for Marescalchi (1785, Venice), Foppa for Zingarelli (1796, Milan), and Buonaiuti for Pietro Carlo Guglielmi (1810, London). The first Italian libretto explicitly based on Shakespeare’s play did not appear until 1865; it was by M. M. Marcello, for Filippo Marchetti’s Romeo e Giulietta given in Trieste. Bellini was persuaded to write the opera for the 1830 Carnival season at the Teatro La Fenice in Venice, with only a month and a half available for composition. He succeeded by appropriating a large amount of music previously written for his unsuccessful opera Zaira. The first performance of I Capuleti e i Montecchi took place on 11 March 1830."

      "description": "Medieval folk rock, medieval rock or medieval folk is a musical subgenre that emerged in the early 1970s in England and Germany which combined elements of early music with rock music. It grew out of the electric folk and progressive folk movements of the later 1960s. Despite the name, the term was used indiscriminately to categorise performers who incorporated elements of medieval, renaissance and baroque music into their work and sometimes to describe groups who used few, or no, electric instruments. This subgenre reached its height towards the middle of the 1970s when it achieved some mainstream success in Britain, but within a few years most groups had either disbanded, or were absorbed into the wider movements of progressive folk and progressive rock. Nevertheless, the genre had a considerable impact within progressive rock where early music and medievalism in general, was a major influence and through that in the development of heavy metal. More recently medieval folk rock has revived in popularity along with other forms of medieval inspired music such as Dark Wave orientated neo-Medieval music and medieval metal.",

It originated in the late 19th century Cuban blackface theatre, where some elements from Afro-Cuban music traditions such as Santería and Palo were incorporated into a secular context. As a result, black themes were occasionally portrayed in a stereotypical and derogatory manner. Nonetheless, many afros accurately depicted the working-class life of black communities in Cuba.Afros are sung in a creolized form of Spanish, often similar to bozal. In the 1940s and 1950s, the genre reached its peak of popularity often mixing with son cubano giving rise to the hybrid style known as afro-son (or son-afro). Compositions not based on the son structure were often labelled as canción afro (afro-song) or canción de cuna afro (afro-lullaby); the latter became a popular form, especially due to the popularity of Ernesto Grenet's \"Drume negrita\". Among the most notable singers of afro were Rita Montaner, Bola de Nieve, Desi Arnaz and Merceditas Valdés.",

      "description": "Ambient music is a genre of music that puts an emphasis on tone and atmosphere over traditional musical structure or rhythm. Ambient music is said to evoke an \"atmospheric\", \"visual,\" or \"unobtrusive\" quality. According to Brian Eno, one of its pioneers, \"Ambient music must be able to accommodate many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular; it must be as ignorable as it is interesting.\" As a genre, it originated in the United Kingdom at a time when new sound-making devices were being introduced to a wider market, such as the synthesizer. Ambient developed in the 1970s from the experimental and synthesizer-oriented styles of the period. Mike Oldfield, Jean Michel Jarre, and Vangelis, as well as the psychoacoustic soundscapes of Irv Teibel's Environments series, were all influences on the emergence of ambient. Robert Fripp and Brian Eno popularized ambient music in 1972 while experimenting with tape loop techniques. The Orb and Aphex Twin gained commercial success with ambient tracks in the early 1990s. Ambient compositions are often quite lengthy, much longer than more popular, commercial forms of music. Some pieces can reach a half an hour or more in length. Ambient had a revival towards the late 1980s with the prominence of house and techno music. Eventually, ambient grew a cult following in the 1990s. By the early 1990s, artists such as Aphex Twin were being called ambient house, ambient techno, IDM, or \"ambient\" by the media. Genre offshoots include dark ambient, ambient house, ambient industrial, ambient dub, psybient, and ambient trance.",

      "description": "John Field's Piano Concerto in A-flat major (H. 31) was published first in Leipzig in 1816.It consists of the usual three movements, in a fast–slow–fast form: Field wrote the piece in classical sonata form; however, he didn't include a cadenza at the end of the first movement due to its relative length, and made the second movement quite short. Field wrote the composition using the more lyric, subdued, slightly melancholy style typical of late Mozart, rather than the joyous \"happy-go-lucky mood\" of Haydn or the bombastic display of Beethoven. In particular, it appears to have some influence from Mozart's famous Clarinet Concerto. In addition, it is imbued with lyric themes and even instrumental embellishments which are reminiscent of those from the composer's native Ireland. In three different sections of the first movement (first in E-flat, then F minor, and lastly A-flat), a lyric section with harp-like movements in the left hand is followed by a driving, audibly Irish-style reel which brings the section to a close with a Mozart-style cadential trill. The influence of his mentor Muzio Clementi (who was apparently an admirer of Mozart) was also important especially in the more Romantic features of the work. It has consistently been the most popular of Field's seven concertos. Composer and critic Robert Schumann rated it highly, and it was the only one never to go out of print at any time. Field's compositions were very popular in the 19th century, but he became relatively unknown during the 20th as musical fashions changed. Due to this, Field is not nearly as well known as contemporaries such as Felix Mendelssohn or Franz Schubert."

The use of the Roland TR-808 sustained kick drum, raised dance tempos, and frequently sexually explicit lyrical content differentiate it from other hip hop subgenres. Music author Richie Unterberger has characterized Miami bass as using rhythms with a \"stop start flavor\" and \"hissy\" cymbals with lyrics that \"reflected the language of the streets, particularly Miami's historically black neighborhoods such as Liberty City and Overtown\". Miami bass has never found consistent mainstream acceptance, though it has had a profound impact on the development of Baltimore club, West Coast hip hop, funk carioca, and other genres.[citation needed]",

He dated its writing by 1946–1947 years (the construction of the Vanino port was completed in June 20, 1945). It was attributed and self-attributed to a number of authors, including a repressed poets Nikolai Zabolotsky, Boris Ruchyov and even to executed by shooting in 1938, Boris Kornilov. Alexander Voznesensky told about F.M. Demin-Blagoveschensky. A Magadan littérateur A.M. Biryukov has researched this issue and showed very convincingly that its author was Konstantin Sarakhanov. The song is named for the port in the village Vanino, on the Pacific coast of Russia. The Vanino port was a transit point for transportation of deported Gulag prisoners who followed the Kolyma. At the station and the port of Vanino there was overloading prisoners from trains on ships following to Magadan - an administrative center of \"Dalstroy\" and Sevvostlag."

Jitterbug and foxtrot music are often included in this category. The music is primarily inspired by swing, schlager, country, jazz, and rock. The main influence for rock-oriented bands is the rock music of the 1950s and 1960s. The terms dansband and dansbandsmusik were coined around 1970, when Swedish popular music developed a signature style. The genre developed primarily in Sweden, but has spread to neighbouring countries Denmark, Norway and the Swedish speaking regions of Finland. When the music came to Norway it was first called \"Svensktoppar\" (from the Swedish radio music chart Svensktoppen, which was a major arena for dansband music before its rules changed in January 2003). A dansband often travels by bus, performing several times every week year-round, outdoors in the summertime and indoors in the wintertime. Performances may also be held on a boat. Several dansbands are named after their lead singer (whose name is sometimes shortened), followed by orkester. The tradition origins from the old dance orchestras, often named after their Kapellmeister. The possessive suffix \"s\" is often replaced by \"z\" in dansband names. Some dansbands are named after earlier members. The main audience for dansband music is middle-aged adults. The music is often performed live by the bands at venues where the main interest of the audience is dancing, rather than watching the performance on stage. However, many dansbands also record albums and singles.",

It is a vocal tradition (kan ha diskan translates from Breton as, roughly, call and response singing). The style is the most commonly used to accompany dances. It has become perhaps the most integral part of the Breton roots revival, and was the first genre of Breton music to gain some mainstream success, both in Brittany and abroad. The lead singer is the kaner, and the second singer is the diskaner. The kaner sings a phrase, and the diskaner sings the last few lines with the kaner, then repeats it alone until the same last few lines, when the kaner again joins in. The phrase's repetition is changed slightly in each execution. Kan ha diskan can be songs about any subject, but must meet one of a number of a meters used in folk dances, mostly line or round. Vocables, or nonsense syllables (typically tra la la la leh no), are sometimes used to drag out lines. Usually a kan ha diskan lasts from 5 to 20 minutes. In addition to the Goadecs, the singer Loeiz Ropars largely responsible for maintaining kan ha diskan's vitality in the middle of the 20th century, and the 1960s and 1970s revivalists drew largely on his work. They also venerated performers like Les frères Morvan and Les soeurs Goadec. During the folk revival, aspiring musicians sought out elder teachers to learn kan ha diskan from, generally being viewed as successful when the student can act as diskaner to his mentor. Teachers of this era included Marcel Guilloux and Yann-Fañch Kemener. An instrumental style similar to kan ha diskan is used by traditional Breton instrument players, particularly with the pairing of the biniou and bombarde."

      "description": "Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock was extremely diverse, with subgenres that include indie pop, jangle pop, and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, a number of indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term. In the mid-1980s, the term \"indie\" began to be used to describe the music produced on punk and post-punk labels. A number of prominent indie rock record labels were founded during the 1980s. During the 1990s, Grunge bands broke into the mainstream, and the term \"alternative\" lost its original counter-cultural meaning. The term \"indie rock\" became associated with the bands and genres that remained dedicated to their independent status. By the end of the 1990s indie rock developed a number of subgenres and related styles. Following indie pop these included lo-fi, noise pop, emo, sadcore, post-rock, space rock and math rock. In the 2000s, changes in the music industry and in music technology enabled a new wave of indie rock bands to achieve mainstream success. In the early 2000s, a new group of bands that played a stripped-down and back-to-basics version of guitar rock emerged into the mainstream. The commercial breakthrough from these scenes was led by four bands: The Strokes, The White Stripes, The Hives and The Vines. Emo also broke into mainstream culture in the early 2000s. By the end of the 2000s the proliferation of indie bands was being referred to as \"indie landfill\". Indietronica took off in the new millennium as digital technology developed, with acts including Broadcast from the UK, Justice from France, Lali Puna from Germany and The Postal Service, Ratatat, and BOBBY from the USA.",

The name is ironic, the piece of ground known as the Holy Ground was the town's red-light district in the 19th century when the town, then known as Queenstown, was a major stopping point for ships crossing the Atlantic and had a large throughput of seafarers.[citation needed] There were plans to build a new yachting marina on the foreshore in front of the Holy Ground, but this is now uncertain. \"The Holy Ground\" is a traditional Irish folk song, performed by The Clancy Brothers, The Dubliners, The Jolly Rogers, the Poxy Boggards, the Brobdingnagian Bards, Mary Black, Pete Seeger, The Tossers, and Beatnik Turtle, among others. John Loesberg points out that although the song is now closely associated with Cobh in Co Cork, it probably originated in Wales where it was known as Old Swansea Town Once More, or sometimes as The Lass of Swansea Town. Robert Gogan describes how the song was a sea shanty sung by sailors as a mental diversion as they carried out various tasks at sea such as raising the anchor."

      "description": "Britpop is a subgenre of hard rock, that originated in the UK. Which based the musical and cultural movement in the late 1990s which emphasized \"Britishness\" in its music and attitude, and produced bright, catchy pop music partly in reaction to the US led grunge music and the UK's own shoegazing music scene. The most successful and best known of the bands associated with the term are Oasis, Blur, Pulp, and Suede. Though Britpop is viewed as a marketing tool, and more of a cultural moment than a musical style or genre, there are musical conventions and influences the bands grouped under the Britpop term have in common, such as showing elements from the British pop music of the Sixties, glam rock and punk rock of the Seventies, and indie pop of the Eighties in their music, attitude, and clothing. An influence they shared in particular was the Smiths whose lead singer Morrissey championed a nostalgic view of Britain. Britpop was a media driven focus on bands which emerged from the independent music scene of the early 1990s - and was associated with Cool Britannia which evoked the Swinging Sixties and the British guitar pop music of that decade. In the wake of the musical invasion into the United Kingdom of American grunge bands, new British groups such as Suede and Blur launched the movement by positioning themselves as opposing musical forces, referencing British guitar music of the past and writing about uniquely British topics and concerns. These bands were soon joined by others including Oasis, the Verve, Pulp, Placebo, Supergrass, Cast, Space, Sleeper and Elastica. Britpop groups brought British alternative rock into the mainstream and formed the backbone of a larger British cultural movement called Cool Britannia. A chart battle between Blur and Oasis dubbed \"The Battle of Britpop\" brought Britpop to the forefront of the British press in 1995. By 1997, however, the movement began to slow down; many acts began to falter and broke up. The popularity of the pop group the Spice Girls captured the \"spirit of the age from those responsible for Britpop.\" Although its more popular bands were able to spread their commercial success overseas, especially to the United States, the movement largely fell apart by the end of the decade.",

Elgar composed it in the aftermath of the First World War, when his music had already gone out of fashion with the concert-going public. In contrast with Elgar's earlier Violin Concerto, which is lyrical and passionate, the Cello Concerto is for the most part contemplative and elegiac. The first performance was a debacle because Elgar and the performers had been deprived of adequate rehearsal time. The work did not achieve wide popularity until the 1960s, when a recording by Jacqueline du Pré caught the public imagination and became a classical best-seller. Elgar made two recordings of the work with Beatrice Harrison as soloist. Since then, leading cellists from Pablo Casals onward have performed the work in concert and in the studio."

The medieval Faustian story concerns an ugly, crippled girl, who dreams of being beautiful and meeting a handsome prince. The Devil offers her a magical stone that confers perfect beauty to anyone who wears it. The stone is passed from one character to another, but eventually the prince recognizes the girl's beautiful soul, the stone is discarded, and the disappointed Devil leaves the town. It premiered at the Savoy Theatre on 28 May 1898, closing on 16 July 1898 after a run of just 50 performances, making it the least successful of Sullivan's operas. Reviewers criticised the lyrics and lengthy dialogue scenes and the lack of humour in the story. Savoy audiences, accustomed to more comic and satiric pieces, did not find the opera attractive. The cast of The Beauty Stone included Savoy regulars Walter Passmore, Rosina Brandram, Ruth Vincent, Emmie Owen and Henry Lytton, as well as opera singer Pauline Joran. The opera was revived by the Carl Rosa Opera Company in 1901–02 on tour in a cut version."

Performers of crunk music are sometimes referred to as \"crunksters\". Crunk is often up-tempo and one of Southern hip hop's more club-oriented subgenres. An archetypal crunk track most frequently uses a drum machine rhythm, heavy bassline, and shouting vocals, often in a call and response manner. The term \"crunk\" is also used as a blanket term to denote any style of Southern hip hop, a side effect of the genre's breakthrough to the mainstream. The word derives from a slang past-tense form, \"crunk\", of the verb \"to crank\" (as in the phrase \"crank up\"), but has also been popularly assumed to mean \"cronic-drunk\", or \"crazy drunk\", after association with Crunk Juice, a brand of strong alcoholic beverage associated with the music genre. The term also means getting hyped or excited.",

It is often played at a fast tempo with occasional slow sections. Vocals are usually guttural and may be grunted, growled or screamed. Crust punk takes cues from the anarcho-punk of Crass and Discharge and the extreme metal of bands like Venom, Hellhammer/Celtic Frost and Motörhead.

Influential bands in the scene were Pop Will Eat Itself (who had songs titled, \"Oh Grebo I Think I Love You\" and \"Grebo Guru\"), The Wonder Stuff, Ned's Atomic Dustbin, along with London band Carter USM and Leicester bands Crazyhead, The Bomb Party, The Hunters Club, Scum Pups and Gaye Bykers on Acid. London-based band Medicine Factory (later known as Stark) were also active on the scene in the late 80s and early 90s. The term has also been used to describe Jesus Jones, who enjoyed success in both the UK and US. The musical styles of the bands were a blend of garage rock, the more alternative forms of rock, pop, hip-hop, and electronica. The musical genre found favour with adherents of the earlier Post-punk roots of Gothic rock such as Mick Mercer which by the late 1980s had changed character significantly. The Grebo fashion style was dreadlocks, partially shaved heads and high ponytails, undercut or shaved long hair, leather bike jackets and/or jeans, baggy clothing, boots, lumberjack shirts, loose tatty jeans, army surplus clothing, and eccentric hats and scarfs. The movement, although short-lived, was a reasonable success at the time, and influenced a number of later bands. To a certain extent it was a music press invention, much like positive punk, a scene and style named by British indie magazines, specifically NME and the Melody Maker. The scene occupied the period in the late 1980s and early 1990s before Grunge, Britpop and other forms of Anglo-American alternative rock took over.",

      "description": "Christian metal, also known as white metal or heavenly metal, is a form of heavy metal music usually defined by its message using song lyrics as well as the dedication of the band members to Christianity. Christian metal is typically performed by professed Christians sometimes principally for Christians who listen to heavy metal music and often produced and distributed through various Christian networks. Christian metal bands exist in all the subgenres of heavy metal music, and the only common link among most Christian metal bands are the lyrics. The Christian themes are often melded with the subjects of the genre the band is rooted in, regularly providing a Christian take on the subject matter. It has been argued that the marginal yet transnational Christian metal subculture provides its core members an alternative religious expression and Christian identity, and that the music serves the purpose of offering a positive message through lyrical content. This may not necessarily show a direct connection or reference to the Christian faith but often it does. Christian metal emerged in the late 1970s as a means of evangelization to the wider heavy metal music scene and was pioneered by the American Resurrection Band and Barnabas, the Swedish Jerusalem, and Canadian Daniel Band. Los Angeles' Stryper achieved wide success in the 1980s. In the mid to late 1980s, extreme metal genres were popularized by bands such as Vengeance Rising, Deliverance, Believer and Tourniquet. In the early 1990, the Australian death metal band Mortification rose to prominence within its country's underground metal scene. At the turn of the 21st century, the nu metal band P.O.D, with two platinum-selling albums, achieved a mainstream commercial success rivaling that of Stryper. The metalcore groups Underoath, Demon Hunter, As I Lay Dying and Norma Jean (dubbed by Revolver Magazine as \"The Holy Alliance\") also brought some mainstream attention to the movement in the first decade of the 2000s, achieving ranks in the Billboard 200.",

      "description": "Messiah (HWV 56) is an English-language oratorio composed in 1741 by George Frideric Handel, with a scriptural text compiled by Charles Jennens from the King James Bible, and from the version of the Psalms included with the Book of Common Prayer. It was first performed in Dublin on 13 April 1742 and received its London premiere nearly a year later. After an initially modest public reception, the oratorio gained in popularity, eventually becoming one of the best-known and most frequently performed choral works in Western music. Handel's reputation in England, where he had lived since 1712, had been established through his compositions of Italian opera. He turned to English oratorio in the 1730s in response to changes in public taste; Messiah was his sixth work in this genre. Although its structure resembles that of opera, it is not in dramatic form; there are no impersonations of characters and no direct speech. Instead, Jennens's text is an extended reflection on Jesus Christ as Messiah. The text begins in Part I with prophecies by Isaiah and others, and moves to the annunciation to the shepherds, the only \"scene\" taken from the Gospels. In Part II, Handel concentrates on the Passion and ends with the \"Hallelujah\" chorus. In Part III he covers the resurrection of the dead and Christ's glorification in heaven. Handel wrote Messiah for modest vocal and instrumental forces, with optional settings for many of the individual numbers. In the years after his death, the work was adapted for performance on a much larger scale, with giant orchestras and choirs. In other efforts to update it, its orchestration was revised and amplified by (among others) Mozart. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries the trend has been towards reproducing a greater fidelity to Handel's original intentions, although \"big Messiah\" productions continue to be mounted. A near-complete version was issued on 78 rpm discs in 1928; since then the work has been recorded many times."

The first is from English Folk Songs from the Southern Appalachians published in 1917, indicating that Gospel Plow dates from at least the early twentieth century.

The Symphony Orchestra of Pécs, recently renamed as Pannon Philharmonic Orchestra was founded in 1811. Its legal predecessor was the Musicians' Society (Tonkünstler Sozietät) founded by György Lickl (Johann Georg), a contemporary of Mozart and a disciple of Haydn, but the orchestra became a fully autonomous artistic institution in 1984, led by conductor and artistic director Tamás Breitner, and including 92 member artists. Other major conductors and directors of the city's orchestra include Nicolás Pasquet, Howard Williams, Zsolt Hamar and Tibor Boganyi (current conductor). Pécs was European Capital of Culture in 2010 and a new concert-hall, the Kodaly Centre, was opened during that year. At the 2006 World Choir Games organized in Xiamen, the Béla Bartók Male Choir from Pécs won the Olympic champion title ahead of the several hundred choirs from 82 countries competing at the event."

It is also associated with a number of country music artists including Steve Earle and Joe Ely, along with less widely known acts such as the Iron City Houserockers. The genre developed in the 1970s and reached its commercial peak in the 1980s, when it became one of the best-selling genres in the United States. In the 1990s, many established acts faded and the genre began to fragment, but the major figures have continued to record with commercial success.",

      "genre": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Punk_pathetique",
      "description": "Punk pathetique is a subgenre of British punk rock (principally active circa 1980–1982) that involved humour and working class cultural themes. The name of the genre was coined by then-Sounds journalist Garry Bushell, who actively championed many of its exponents. Punk pathetique was initially an attempt to characterize a group of London bands that embodied Cockney culture with a Dickensian working class attitude. Musically it was related to (and had crossover with) the Oi! subgenre. The cover of the 1980 Bushell/Sounds compilation album Oi the Album described the record as featuring \"ruck 'n' rollers and punk pathetiques\". In contrast to harder-edged Oi! bands with more serious lyrics, punk pathetique bands focused on the naughty, silly and trivial. Max Splodge of Splodgenessabounds said: \"The pathetique bands are the other side of Oi! We're working class too, only whereas some bands sing about prison and the dole, we sing about pilchards and bums. The audience is the same.\" Some punk pathetique bands had notable success in the UK charts. Toy Dolls got to #4 in December 1984 with \"Nellie the Elephant.\" Splodgenessabounds reached #7 in 1980 with \"Simon Templar,\" and #26 with \"Two Little Boys\" later that year. According to Bushell: Peter and the Test Tube Babies were first featured in Sounds in July 1980, and made their vinyl debut on Oi! The Album later that year. They favoured absurd lyrics and strange titles, such as \"The Queen Gives Good Blow Jobs\" and \"Elvis Is Dead (He Was 42 and a Fat Cunt\"). Toy Dolls, based in Sunderland, shared the punk pathetique approach to nonsensical entertainment. Toy Dolls singer Michael \"Olga\" Algar told Sounds in March 1980: \"We're a new wave group, but we're not serious. All our songs are pretty childish and infantile, but they're all based on things and people 'round here.\" Bushell wrote that punk pathetique peaked in autumn 1980, with the Pathetique Convention staged at the Electric Ballroom. However, music critic Dave Thompson has stated of Splodgenessabounds' 1981 album: Other punk pathetique bands included TV Personalities, The Shapes, The Adicts, Notsensibles, The Gonads, The Postmen, Desert Island Joe, The Hoopers, Pierre The Poet (Garry Butterfield), Paul Devine, Lord Waistrel & the Cosh Boys, Stephen Louis Knoche Jr & His Raging Cronies, The Alaska Cowboys, Percy Throwers Man Eating Plans, SexyCows, and The Orgasm Guerrillas. Later, the mantle was inherited by the Bus Station Loonies, Monkish and Macc Lads, who performed comic punk singalongs in very much the same style. Toy Dolls, Peter and the Test Tube Babies, The Gonads and Splodgenessabounds continue to tour and record.",

Unlike dee jaying (also known as toasting), which also features the use of the spoken word, the dub poet's performance is normally prepared, rather than the extemporized chat of the dancehall dee jay. In musical setting, the dub poet usually appears on stage with a band performing music specifically written to accompany each poem, rather than simply perform over the top of dub plates, or riddims, in the dancehall fashion. Musicality is built into dub poems, yet, dub poets generally perform without backing music, delivering chanted speech with pronounced rhythmic accentuation and dramatic stylization of gesture. Sometimes dub music effects, e.g. echo, reverb, are dubbed spontaneously by a poet into live versions of a poem. Many dub poets also employ call-and-response devices to engage audiences.",

      "description": "Country rap is a subgenre of popular music blending country music with hip hop-style rapping, also known as hick-hop or rural rap. Country rap began to form as a genre when Bubba Sparxxx and producer Shannon \"Fat Shan\" Houchins created Sparxxx's 2001 debut album Dark Days, Bright Nights as an independent release which was later re-released on Interscope Records. The trend continued in 2005 when country artists Big & Rich introduced Cowboy Troy to the country world via 2005's Loco Motive released on Warner Brothers, which reached #2 on Billboard's Top Country Albums chart. Coming off the success of Bubba Sparxxx's platinum album debut, Houchins soon after created Average Joes Entertainment with country rapper Colt Ford. This was the beginning of country rap taking its place as a real and separate genre while at the same time influencing mainstream country. Colt Ford has sold over 1.5 million albums including 4 that have landed in the top 10 of Billboard's Country Music chart. Ford's 2012 Declaration Of Independence debuted at #1 on Billboard's Country Chart and his 2014 album Thanks For Listening debuted at #1 on the Billboard Rap Chart making him the only artist in history to have #1 albums on both Billboard Country and Rap Charts, proving that country rap is a true genre and spawning a slew of new artists. The Lacs and Lenny Cooper have both sold well. The Lacs' third and fourth albums Keep It Redneck and Outlaw In Me both debuted #3 on Billboard's Country Chart in August 2013 proving further country rap's popularity as a new genre. Other artists of this genre include Lenny Cooper, Moonshine Bandits, Big Smo, Jawga Boyz, Twang & Round, Demun Jones, Sarah Ross, Charlie Farley, Cap Bailey, Cypress Spring, Moccasin Creek, Olivia Lane, and Redneck Souljers. Country traditionalists Toby Keith, Trace Adkins and Blake Shelton have since adapted elements of country rap into their music in recent years. Music journalist Chuck Eddy, in The Accidental Evolution of Rock 'n' Roll, traces the genre's roots back to Woody Guthrie.",

      "description": "Rebecca Clarke's Sonata for Viola and Piano is first known of in 1919, when the composer was 33 years old. Clarke had moved to the United States in 1916, after being disowned by her father. She had been supporting herself with some success as a soloist. The first reference to the Viola Sonata was upon its submission to a composition competition sponsored by Clarke's neighbor, Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge. Out of 72 entries, Clarke's Sonata tied for first with a piece by the Swiss composer, Ernest Bloch. In the end Bloch was declared the winner, despite all the judges favouring Clarke—it was decided that declaring Clarke the winner would smack of favouritism on Coolidge's part. It was also suspected by some that the name \"Rebecca Clarke\" was a pen-name of a male composer, as few imagined the possibility of a competent female writing such music. The piece had its première at the Berkshire Music Festival in 1919, and was well received. It, along with the Piano Trio of 1921 and the Rhapsody for cello and piano of 1923, represent the zenith of her compositional career, though afterwards Clarke wrote hardly any more music. The sonata was first published in 1921 by Chester Music. Clarke gives us an incipit on the first page of the sonata, a quote from La Nuit de mai (1835) by the French poet Alfred de Musset: The sonata is cast in three movements. Because of the many different obstacles the piece presents, as well as its highly idiomatic writing, it is becoming more and more a staple of the violist's repertoire. The Rebecca Clarke Society commissioned an orchestration of the Viola Sonata from composer Ruth Lomon. It was premiered in 2007 by violist Peter Sulski. Subsequent performances have featured soloists Esra Pelivahnli, Catherine Hanson, and Melissa Matson."

Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the upbeat. Ska developed in Jamaica in the 1960s when Prince Buster, Clement \"Coxsone\" Dodd, and Duke Reid formed sound systems to play American rhythm & blues and then began recording their own songs. In the early 1960s, ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British mods. Later it became popular with many skinheads. Music historians typically divide the history of ska into three periods: the original Jamaican scene of the 1960s; the English 2 Tone ska revival of the late 1970s, which fused Jamaican ska rhythms and melodies with the faster tempos and harder edge of punk rock; and the third wave of ska, which involved bands from the UK, other European countries (notably Germany), Australia, Japan, South America and the US, beginning in the 1980s and peaking in the 1990s.",

The compositions usually feature a delicate melody and scarce musical background, often comprising a guitar or piano. Some sung poetry performers are singer-songwriters, others use known, published poems, or collaborate with contemporary writers. Artists of sung poetry include people of various occupations usually with little or no particular music education, as well as stage actors. Sung poetry shares much in common with the author's song in Russia yet differs from it in a significant way: sung poetry performers often do not compose lyrics themselves. Similar artists in other countries are usually classified as bards, folk music or folk rock (such as Jacques Brel, Lluís Llach, Ovidi Montllor, Georges Brassens, Léo Ferré, Bob Dylan, Simon and Garfunkel, Tom Waits, Leonard Cohen, Djordje Balasevic, Bulat Okudzhava, Vladimir Vysotsky, Paco Ibáñez), or chamber pop. Artists of other musical genres may or may not be included into sung poetry category. For instance Czesław Niemen whose many songs are based on works of esteemed Polish poets is usually regarded as either a rock or electronic musician. The common forms of expression are individual and collective public performances, festivals of sung poetry, publication of records online and release of music albums."

Cellos, often in groups of three or more, are used to create a sound, rhythm, and texture similar to that of familiar rock music, but distinctly reshaped by the unique timbres and more traditional genres of the cello (in particular) and other string instruments used. The cellos and other stringed instruments are often amplified and/or modified electronically, and often played in a manner imitative of the sound of electric guitars. They are often combined with other elements typical of rock music such as rock-style vocals and drumming. Cello rock can trace its beginnings back to the 1971 self-titled debut, known in the US as No Answer, by The Electric Light Orchestra which featured rock songs arranged for cellos, and the subsequent tour consisted of a standard rock band augmented by four cellos.

      "description": "Doctor Ox's Experiment is an opera in two acts by Gavin Bryars. It has an English-language libretto by Blake Morrison after the novella of the same name by Jules Verne. It was first performed on 15 June 1998 at the London Coliseum by English National Opera (ENO) who co-commissioned the opera with BBC Television. In the experiment of the title, Doctor Ox introduces a gas into a sedate and conservative Flemish village with the result that everyone and everything becomes speeded up and chaotic. (Ox's and his assistant's names combine to make Oxygėne, the French name for Oxygen.)` The opera explores the conflict between Ox's advocacy of modernity and scientific and political change and Ygène's belief that liberation and the accompanying loss of the traditional rhythms of life might bring unhappiness. The music is predominantly slow-moving and quiet. Bryars allocated distinct voice types to the different types of roles: town elders, young lovers and scientists. He also included some unusual instruments in his orchestra: an oboe d'amore and an amplified jazz bass in the love scene, an electronic keyboard and a flugelhorn instead of trumpets in the brass section. The reception was mixed with several critics complaining of boredom while others wrote of members of the audience being entranced by the music."

      "description": "Nu metal (also known as nü-metal and aggro-metal) is a form of alternative metal that combines elements of heavy metal music with elements of other music genres such as hip hop, alternative rock, funk and grunge. Nu metal bands have drawn elements and influences from a variety of musical styles, including multiple genres of heavy metal. Nu metal rarely features guitar solos; it is heavily syncopated and based on guitar riffs. Many nu metal guitarists use seven-string guitars that are down-tuned to play a heavier sound. DJs are occasionally featured in nu metal to provide instrumentation such as sampling, turntable scratching and electronic backgrounds. Vocal styles in nu metal include singing, rapping, screaming and growling. At the time of the release of Korn's 1996 album Life is Peachy, the popularity of nu metal was beginning to grow, and broke into the mainsteam in 1998. In the late 1990s, some bands were blending nu metal with other music genres. For example, industrial metal elements were incorporated into the music of Static-X and Dope. In 2003, MTV wrote that nu metal's popularity was declining, but nu metal still had mainstream success. During the mid-2000s, nu metal lost popularity and metalcore became one of the most popular genres within the New Wave of American Heavy Metal. During this period, classic rock-inspired bands and emo bands grew in popularity and exceeded the declining popularity of nu metal. Also, during this period, many nu metal bands experimented with other styles of music, or in some cases, changed their style altogether. Nu metal is one of the key genres of the New Wave of American Heavy Metal.",

This sunny and tuneful piece manages to combine effective apparent pianistic pyrotechnics whilst keeping it within the range of ability of a keen student. The piece has three movements: The opening movement begins with a dramatic trumpet fanfare, followed by swirling piano writing that has a touch of the great piano concertos of Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninov. There is a central dramatic cadenza before the opening theme returns, the movement ending with the same short fanfare. The second movement begins in G minor in a far more austere style, using pizzicato string notes over which a melody is played in octaves on the piano. There is a shimmering central section at a faster tempo that moves through various major keys before the opening minor theme is restated, but this time with a forte from the full orchestra. The opening quiet atmosphere eventually returns at the end of this movement. The final movement starts at breakneck speed, which is only briefly interrupted in the middle by a little march. Just before the end a sweeping romantic melody first heard in the first movement is played at full volume before the concerto ends with a prestissimo coda. The work shares themes in common with Kabalevsky's Rhapsody for Piano and Orchestra, op.75, on the theme of the song \"School Years\"."

Shri Rudram is also known as Sri Rudraprasna, Śatarudrīya, and Rudradhyaya. The text is important in Saivism where Shiva is viewed as the Supreme God. The hymn is an early example of enumerating the names of a deity, a tradition developed extensively in the sahasranama literature of Hinduism. By the first few centuries CE, the recitation of the Śatarudrīya is claimed, in the Jābala Upanishad, to lead to immortality. The hymn is referred to in the Shiva Purana. The text is also famous for its mention of the Shaivite Panchakshara (\"five-syllable\") mantra (Sanskrit: Namaḥ Śivāya), which appears in the text of the Śatarudrīya in the eighth anuvaka. The text also contains the mantra Aum Namah Bhagavathe Rudraya. Through the chanting of Sri Rudram, Lord Siva's various attributes and aspects are invoked and worshipped. Chanting the Rudram is considered to be of great benefit. The Rudram chanting can be done with or without the accompaniment of a Vedic yagna ritual. When accompanied with the Vedic fire ritual, it is called the Rudra Yagnam. It is said that Lord Shiva, after Bhasmasura was killed with the help of Lord Maha Vishnu, performed the Tandava Dance and then performed the \"Rudra Yagna\" for the betterment of humanity. The place where the Rudra Yagna was performed is where the \"Sri Kalahasti\" Temple stands now; this temple also has one of the 5 (Pancha bhootha - Vayu, Agni, Jala, Akash, Prithvi) lingas called Vayu v."

NWOAHM includes a wide variety of styles, including alternative metal, groove metal, industrial metal, nu metal and metalcore. Although the term is used by the media with increasing frequency, the definition has not been finished completely. This is due in part to the growing addition of bands that assimilate to common styles in NWOAHM (as defined below), yet have not differentiated greatly enough as to garner a new genre moniker.

It was written in 1986 and dedicated to the conductor Gennady Rozhdestvensky, who gave the first performance in West Berlin with the Moscow State Symphony Orchestra on September 4, 1986. It takes the two words of its title from a poem by Francisco Tanzer. Stimmen... Verstummen... is primarily organized around two themes. The first is that of a major triad, occurring as D-major in the first, third, and fifth movements and as a G-major triad in the tenth and twelfth movements. The second theme, that of \"effort and ruin\", occurs in the second, fourth, and sixth movement. Movements I, III, V, and VII become progressively shorter according to the proportions of the Fibonacci sequence. The symphony is notable for its careful and innovative use of silence. Though the eighth movement has the largest proportions of the work, the climax actually takes place in the ninth movement when the conductor motions before a silent orchestra. The motions the conductor makes are meant to make his hands move increasingly farther apart from each other according to the Fibonacci sequence. This \"conductor solo\" is repeated at the end of the work, when after the last note is sounded the conductor continues to motion for several minutes."

They are very different from the trio sonatas in the Italian manner (such as those of Corelli), where the harpsichord is only providing the role of a continuo bass. In Rameau's works, the harpsichord is at the heart of the ensemble, playing a fully written-out obbligato part with virtuosity, with the accompaniment falling to the violin and viola da gamba. Rameau provided for differing instrumental combinations: the flute can replace the violin and a second violin can replace the viola da gamba. It is possible to compare these works with the violin sonatas of Johann Sebastian Bach, written earlier, around 1720, in which the melodic material is shared equally between the violin and harpsichord and the harpsichord part is obbligato nearly throughout. They are divided into five concerts of 3 to 6 movements with typical French 'character' names, some of which can be enigmatic: a name of a place (Le Vézinet), of character (La timide, L'agaçante) or of persons (La Forqueray, La Marais, La Rameau). The last type of appellation was not used by Jean-Philippe Rameau for his solo harpsichord works."

Royal Canadian Sea Cadets sing \"Heart of Oak\" during days of their parades. (It was also the official march of the Royal Australian Navy, but has now been replaced by the new march, \"Royal Australian Navy\"). The music was composed by Dr. William Boyce, and the words were written by the 18th-century English actor David Garrick. \"Heart of Oak\" was originally written as part of an opera. It first saw the light of day on New Year's Eve of 1760, sung by Samuel Thomas Champnes, one of Handel's soloists, in Garrick's pantomime \"Harlequin's Invasion\", at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. The \"wonderful year\" referenced in the first verse was 1759, an \"Annus mirabilis\" during which British forces were victorious in several significant battles: the Battle of Minden on 1 August 1759, the Battle of Lagos on 19 August 1759, the Battle of the Plains of Abraham (outside Quebec City) on 13 September 1759, and the Battle of Quiberon Bay on 20 November 1759. (This battle foiled a French invasion project planned by the Duc de Choiseul to knock Britain out of the Seven Years' War, hence the reference in the song to 'flat-bottom' invasion barges). These victories were followed a few months later by the Battle of Wandiwash in India on 22 January 1760. Britain's continued success in the war boosted the song's popularity. It was also referenced on television, in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode Allegiance. The fictional character Jean-Luc Picard sings the song while drinking an ale in a bar. The oak in the song's title refers to the wood from which British warships were traditionally made in the age of sail. The \"Heart of oak\" is the strongest central wood of the tree. The phrase \"hearts of oak\" appears in English translations of the Aeneid. The reference to \"freemen not slaves\" echos the refrain \"Britons never will be slaves!\" of Rule, Britannia!, written two decades earlier."

Humorous songs, or those containing humorous elements, are not necessarily novelty songs. The term arose in Tin Pan Alley to describe one of the major divisions of popular music. The other two divisions were ballads and dance music. Novelty songs achieved great popularity during the 1920s and 1930s. They had a resurgence of interest in the 1950s and 1960s. Novelty songs are often a parody or humor song, and may apply to a current event such as a holiday or a fad such as a dance or TV programme. Many use unusual lyrics, subjects, sounds, or instrumentation, and may not even be musical. For example, the 1966 novelty song \"They're Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!\" has little music and is set to a rhythm tapped out on a snare drum and tambourine. A famous book on achieving an attention-grabbing novelty single is \"The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way)\", written by The KLF. It is based on their achievement of a UK number-one single with \"Doctorin the Tardis\", a 1988 dance remix mashup of the Doctor Who theme song released under the name of 'The Timelords.' It argued that (at the time) achieving a number one single could be achieved less by musical talent than through market research, sampling and gimmicks matched to an underlying danceable groove.",

The following year her mega-hit \"Roll up de Tassa\" was instrumental in creating a commercial market for this type of music internationally. Drupatee has spoken about the blending of Afro and Indo melodies and rhythms in songs such as \"Chatnee Soca\" and \"Hotter than ah Chulha\". Chutney is a melody and soca is a beat. Drupatee used an ancient Indian melody called a lawnee with the soca beat in her rendition of \"O Tassawalley\" and has released a legacy of Chutney soca music.",

He composed it in Leipzig to celebrate the 57th birthday of the Elector of Saxony, King Augustus II the Strong, and it was performed for him on his birthday, 12 May 1727, on the Marktplatz of Leipzig, by students of the University of Leipzig, with Bach directing. The king was also presented with the work's libretto, written by Christian Friedrich Haupt. The music to this secular birthday cantata by Bach is lost. It has been speculated from the surviving libretto, however, that several movements from the Mass in B minor are derived from it. A reconstruction has been created using the music of the Mass."

The word \"Illbient\" is a portmanteau of the hip hop slang term \"ill\" (a positive expression: bad meaning good) and \"ambient\". Psychedelic musician Helios Creed joked that \"although Eno invented ambient music while ill in bed - 'illbient' is actually an extreme retro offshoot that demands that the listener produces a doctor's note before being allowed to purchase.\"[citation needed] Though there are many individualistic variants of illbient, the music is characterized by interesting dub-wise layering of soundscapes, hip hop-influenced use of samples and a progressive approach to beat programming that encompasses all genres of world groove and electronic music. Usually, but not always, illbient uses beats more than purely ambient music (or dark ambient), and often illbient includes loops in the recordings. Illbient was introduced to the public at large in 1996 through the Asphodel Records Incursions in Illbient compilation and a feature in The Wire magazine.[citation needed]",

The composer completed the score in 1927, but it was not premiered until 1 December 1937, at the Royal College of Music, London. The opera remained largely the province of students and amateurs until it entered the repertoire of Sadler's Wells in 1953. Vaughan Williams set Synge's text essentially intact, with only a small number of changes. Although the vocal score had been in print since 1936, the full orchestral score was not published until 1973. The composer Edmund Rubbra has characterised this work as less an opera than a \"spoken drama raised in emotional power and expressiveness to the nth degree\". Hugh Ottaway and Michael Kennedy have commented on musical connections between the opera and Vaughan Williams's later Symphony No. 6. Caireann Shannon has noted that Vaughan Williams deliberately avoided use of folksong in the music, and instead relied on the rhythms inherent in Synge's text for the composition."

He was followed by Blind Willie McTell, Barbecue Bob, Charley Lincoln and Curley Weaver, with McTell typically being the most popular and acclaimed. Many of these musicians banded together into groups; the most popular of these bands were the Georgia Cotton Pickers.

The cantata was part of a festive service in the Nikolaikirche. The cantata text by an unknown author includes in movement 2 the beginning of Psalm 75, and as the closing chorale the fifth stanza of Johann Gramann's \"Nun lob, mein Seel, den Herren\". Bach scored the work in eight movements for four vocal parts and a festive Baroque orchestra of three trumpets, timpani, two oboes, strings, an obbligato organ and basso continuo. The organ dominates the first movement Sinfonia which Bach derived from a Partita for violin. The full orchestra accompanies the first choral movement and plays with the voices in the closing chorale, while a sequence of three arias alternating with two recitatives is scored intimately. Bach used the music from the choral movement for both the Gratias agimus tibi and Dona nobis pacem of his Mass in B minor."

The work was dedicated to King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and was first performed at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples on 20 January 1767, the birthday of his father, King Charles III of Spain. The cast featured two stellar singers of the time, Caterina Gabrielli and Anton Raaff, in the leading roles. The opera was only the composer's second one, and the first that permitted him the opportunity to write music for first-rate vocal artists. The production was highly successful, indeed responsible for a meteoric rise in his reputation as an operatic composer. From the time of the premiere of Bellerofonte until his death in 1781, Mysliveček succeeded in having more new opere serie brought into production than any other composer in Europe. During the same time span, he also had more new operas staged at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples than any other composer."

      "description": "Free jazz is an approach to jazz music that was first developed in the 1950s and 1960s as musicians attempted to alter, extend, or break down jazz convention, often by discarding fixed chord changes or tempos. Though the music of free jazz composers varied widely, a common feature was dissatisfaction with the limitations of bebop, hard bop, and modal jazz that had developed in the 1940s and 1950s. Often described as avant-garde, free jazz has also been described as an attempt to return jazz to its primitive, often religious, roots and emphasis on collective improvisation. As its name implies, free jazz cannot be defined more than loosely, as many musicians draw on free jazz concepts and idioms, and it was never completely distinct as a genre. Many free jazz musicians, notably Pharoah Sanders and John Coltrane, used harsh overblowing or other techniques to elicit unconventional sounds from their instruments, or played unusual instruments. Free jazz musicians created a progressive musical language which drew on earlier styles of jazz such as Dixieland jazz and African music. Typically this kind of music is played by small groups of musicians. The music often swings but without regular meter, and there are frequent accelerandi and ritardandi. Free jazz is strongly associated with the 1950s innovations of Ornette Coleman and Cecil Taylor and the later works of saxophonist John Coltrane. Other important pioneers include Charles Mingus, Eric Dolphy, Albert Ayler, Archie Shepp, Joe Maneri and Sun Ra. Coleman pioneered many techniques typical of free jazz, most notably his rejection of pre-written chord changes, believing instead that freely improvised melodic lines should serve as the basis for harmonic progression in his compositions. Some of bassist Charles Mingus's work was also important in establishing free jazz. Of particular note are his early Atlantic albums, such as The Clown, Tijuana Moods, and most notably Pithecanthropus Erectus, the title song of which contained one section that was freely improvised in a style unrelated to the song's melody or chordal structure. Although today \"free jazz\" is the generally used term, many other terms were used to describe the loosely defined movement, including \"avant-garde\", \"energy music\" and \"The New Thing\". During its early and mid-60s heyday, much free jazz was released by established labels such as Prestige, Blue Note, and Impulse, as well as independents such as ESP Disk and BYG Actuel. Keith Johnson of AllMusic describes a \"Modern Creative\" genre, in which \"musicians may incorporate free playing into structured modes -- or play just about anything.\" Johnson includes John Zorn, Henry Kaiser, Eugene Chadbourne, Tim Berne, Bill Frisell, Steve Lacy, Cecil Taylor, Ornette Coleman, and Ray Anderson in this genre, which continues \"the tradition of the '50s to '60s free-jazz mode\".",

      "description": "The Jacobin (Jakobín in Czech) is an opera in three acts by Antonín Dvořák to an original Czech libretto by Marie Červinková-Riegrová. Červinková-Riegrová took some of the story's characters from the story by Alois Jirásek, \"At the Ducal Court\", but devised her own plot about them. The first performance was at the National Theatre, Prague, 1889. Červinková-Riegrová revised the libretto, with Dvořák's permission, in 1894, notably in the last act. Dvořák himself revised the music in 1897 (the revised premiere was on 19 June 1898, under Adolf Čech). The composer felt great affection for the subject of the opera, as the central character is a music teacher, and Dvořák had in mind his former teacher Antonin Liehmann, who had a daughter named Terinka, the name of one of the opera's characters. John Clapham has briefly discussed the presence of Czech musical style in the opera. H. C. Colles has described this opera as \"the most subtle and intimate of his peasant operas\", and noted \"how clearly its scenes are drawn from life\"."

It incorporates hip hop, reggae and African traditional musical styles. The lyrics are in Swahili, Sheng or local dialects. It is associated with Ogopa DJ's and is believed to have originated in the late 1990s with artists such as Redsan, Bebe Cool and Chameleone. It went on to dominate East Africa (especially Kenya and Uganda) airwaves, especially after the release of Ogopa DJs' first album in 2001 which included artists such as the late E-Sir, Nameless, Mr. Lenny, Amani, Mr. Googz and Vinnie Banton amongst others. The over-saturation of this music style caused some to criticise the style including the artists K-South in their hit, \"Kapuka This, Kapuka That.\" This also led to other styles such as genge music being formed by producer Clemo to diversify the market. Despite the critics the music continues to be very popular in Kenya although more so now in Uganda. Of late, \"genge\" has also come to refer more generally to boomba and \"kapuka\" music.",

      "description": "\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" is a song performed by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey, and written and produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff. It was released by Columbia Records on November 1, 1994 as the lead single from her first holiday album and fourth studio album, Merry Christmas. \"Christmas\" is an uptempo love song that includes bell chimes and heavy back-up vocals, as well as use of synthesizers. The song's lyrics declare that the narrator does not care about Christmas presents or lights; all she wants for Christmas is to be with her lover. Two music videos were commissioned for the song: the song's primary music video features grainy home-movie-style footage of Carey, her dogs and family during the holiday season, as well as Carey dressed in a Santa suit frolicking on a snowy mountainside. Carey's then-husband Tommy Mottola makes a cameo appearance as Santa Claus, bringing Carey a gift and leaving on a red sleigh. The second video was filmed in black and white format, and features Carey dressed in 1960s style in homage to The Ronettes, alongside back up singers and female dancers. Carey has performed \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" in a slew of live television appearances and tours throughout her career. In 2010, Carey re-recorded the song for her second holiday album, Merry Christmas II You, titled \"All I Want for Christmas Is You (Extra Festive)\". Carey also re-recorded the song as a duet with Canadian singer Justin Bieber for his 2011 album Under the Mistletoe, titled \"All I Want for Christmas for You (SuperFestive!)\". The song has also been covered by many artists over the years. In the years since its original release, \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" has been critically lauded and has become established as a Christmas standard; it was once called \"one of the few worthy modern additions to the holiday canon\" in The New Yorker, and continues to surge in popularity each holiday season. The song was commercially successful, reaching the number-two position on the singles charts of Australia, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, and the United Kingdom, and the top 10 in several other countries. The Daily Telegraph hailed \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" as the most popular and most played Christmas song of the decade in the United Kingdom. Rolling Stone ranked it fourth on its Greatest Rock and Roll Christmas Songs list, calling it a \"holiday standard.\" In December 2015, the song peaked at 11 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it its highest peak since its original release. With global sales of over 14 million copies, the song remains Carey's biggest international success and the 11th best-selling single of all time. As of 2013, the song was reported to have earned $50 million in royalties."

The German libretto was written by Ernst von Wolzogen, based on J. Ketel's report \"Das erloschene Feuer zu Audenaerde\". It was Strauss' second opera. Thematically, the opera has been interpreted as a parody of Richard Wagner's idea of \"redemption through love\", with the character of Kunrad representing Strauss himself. The conceptual framework for the opera stems from the Nietzschean perspective that had inspired Strauss in his tone poems Till Eulenspiegel and Also sprach Zarathustra. Strauss and von Wolzogen shared the view that the source of inspiration was material not transcendental: in Feuersnot it is \"redemption through sex\" which relights the creative fire."

This Gold Rush-era song, with lyrics written by John A. Stone before 1858, was collected and published in Carl Sandburg's 1927 American Songbag. It was recorded by Burl Ives on February 11, 1941 for his debut album Okeh Presents the Wayfaring Stranger. The melody is of English extraction and is also that of the ballad \"Villikins and his Dinah\". Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time. The terms \"Betsy\" and \"Old Betsy\" were common frontier nicknames for rifles. In the 1980s, poet and scholar John Ciardi theorized that the song was originally a comic tribute to a rifle, portraying it as a pioneer's trusty but fiery companion. He suggested that amended versions sung by countless people had eventually turned it into a song about a real woman. The most verifiable traditional lyrics, which are in the public domain, are:"

The book is the source for several hymns, and the work was extremely popular in the 19th century. It was first published in 1827, and quickly became extremely popular. Though at first anonymous, its authorship soon became known, with the result that Keble was in 1831 appointed Oxford Professor of Poetry, a post that he held until 1841. In his book Heaven, Hell, and the Victorians, Victorian scholar Michael Wheeler calls The Christian Year simply \"the most popular volume of verse in the nineteenth century\". In his essay on \"Tractarian Aesthetics and the Romantic Tradition,\" Gregory Goodwin claims that The Christian Year is \"Keble's greatest contribution to the Oxford Movement and to English literature.\" As evidence of that, Goodwin cites E. B. Pusey's report that ninety-five editions of this devotional text were printed during Keble's lifetime, and \"at the end of the year following his death, the number had arisen to a hundred-and-nine.\" By the time the copyright expired in 1873, over 375,000 copies had been sold in Britain and 158 editions had been published. Despite its widespread appeal among the Victorian readers, the popularity of Keble's The Christian Year quickly faded in the twentieth century."

Hawker, a churchman, assumed that the Trelawny mentioned in the song was Sir Jonathan Trelawny, the Bishop of Bristol, who had been imprisoned in the Tower of London by King James II in 1688. However it is more likely that it referred to his grandfather, Sir John Trelawny, a Cornish Royalist leader who had been imprisoned by parliament in 1628. According to Cornish historian Robert Morton Nance, The Song of the Western Men was possibly inspired by the song Come, all ye jolly tinner boys which was written more than ten years earlier in about 1807, when Napoleon Bonaparte made threats that would affect trade in Cornwall at the time of the invasion of Poland. Ye jolly tinner boys contains the line \"Why forty thousand Cornish boys shall knawa the reason why.\" The song has become one of the unofficial anthems of Cornwall and is a regular favourite sung at Cornish rugby union matches and other Cornish gatherings. In some schools in Cornwall, the children are taught the first verse and chorus, and sing it at events such as Murdoch Day and St Piran's Day. However, the people of Cornwall did not march to rescue Trelawny, as told in the song. He was imprisoned in the Tower of London for three weeks, then tried and acquitted."

The Times and Seasons first published the words on 15 November 1845, more than a year after Joseph Smith, Jr. was killed.

The term \"girl group\" is also used in a narrower sense within English-speaking countries to denote the wave of American female pop music singing groups which flourished in the late 1950s and early 1960s between the decline of early rock and roll and the British Invasion, many of whom were influenced by doo-wop style. All-female bands, in which members also play instruments, are usually considered a separate phenomenon. These groups are sometimes called \"girl bands\" to differentiate, although this terminology is not universally followed, and these bands are sometimes also called girl groups. With the advent of the music industry and radio broadcasting, a number of girl groups emerged, such as the Andrews Sisters. The late 1950s saw the emergence of all-female singing groups as a major force, with 750 distinct girl groups releasing songs that reached US and UK music charts from 1960 to 1966. the Supremes alone held 12 number-one singles on The Billboard Hot 100 during the height of the wave and throughout most of the British Invasion rivaled the Beatles in popularity. In later eras, the girl group template would be applied to disco, contemporary R&B, and country-based formats, as well as pop. A more globalized music industry saw the extreme popularity of dance-oriented pop music led by major record labels. This emergence, led by the US, UK, South Korea, and Japan, produced extremely popular acts, with eight groups debuting after 1990 having sold more than 15 million physical copies of their albums. Also, since the late 2000s, South Korea has had a significant impact, with 8 of the top 10 girl groups by digital sales in the world originating there.",

It was first performed on April 27, 1673, by the Paris Opera at the Jeu de paume de Béquet. The prologue, in praise of King Louis XIV, represents him as Apollo slaying the Python of Delphi. The opera itself concerns the love story of Cadmus, legendary founder and king of Thebes, Greece, and Hermione (Harmonia), daughter of Venus and Mars. Other characters include Pallas Athene, Cupid, Juno, and Jupiter. With Cadmus et Hermione, Lully invented the form of the tragédie en musique (also known as tragédie lyrique). From contemporary Venetian opera, Lully incorporated elements of comedy among the servants, elements which he would later avoid, as would subsequent reformers in Italian opera. A contemporary transcription of the overture by Jean-Henri d’Anglebert remains a possible part of the harpsichord repertoire. In early 2008, the French ensemble Le Poème Harmonique staged a performance of the opera in Paris and Rouen, among other places."

      "description": "Surf music is a subgenre of rock music associated with surf culture, particularly as found in Orange County and other areas of Southern California. It was especially popular from 1962 to 1964 in two major forms. The first is instrumental surf, distinguished by reverb-drenched electric guitars played to evoke the sound of crashing waves, largely pioneered by Dick Dale and the Del-Tones. The second is vocal surf, which took the original surf sound and added vocal harmonies backed by basic Chuck Berry rhythms, a movement led by the Beach Boys. Dick Dale developed the surf sound from instrumental rock, where he added Middle Eastern and Mexican influences, spring reverb, and the rapid alternate picking characteristics. His regional hit \"Let's Go Trippin'\" (1961) launched the surf music craze, inspiring many others to take up the approach. The genre first achieved national exposure when it was represented by vocal groups such as the Beach Boys, Jan and Dean, and Bruce & Terry. Their \"vocal surf\" style drew more from African-American genres such as doo wop with its scat singing and tight harmonies. Dale is quoted on such groups: \"They were surfing sounds [with] surfing lyrics. In other words, the music wasn't surfing music. The words made them surfing songs. ... That was the difference ... the real surfing music is instrumental.\" At the height of its popularity, surf music rivaled girl groups and Motown for top American popular music trends. Surf music is sometimes referred to interchangeably with the California Sound. Many notable surf bands have been equally noted for both instrumental and vocal surf music, so surf music is generally considered as a single genre despite the variety of these styles.[verification needed] During the later stages of the surf music craze, many groups started to leave surfing behind and write songs about cars and girls; this was later known as hot rod rock.",

This symphony, like many others by Stamitz, influenced Joseph Haydn and Mozart.[citation needed] It is approximately fifteen minutes in length, and demonstrates Stamitz's late symphonic style. It demonstrates the culmination of the Mannheim school of orchestral playing which emphasized extended techniques for the instruments ( musicians at this time were mostly people with free time and simply played when asked), among them an attention to detail of dynamics. The concept of \"Sturm und Drang\", German for approximately storminess, or a very angular sharp contrast musically can be seen in this work with very sudden dynamic changes and a sharp texture change, presented when the oboes enter with the Beta Theme, or \"B\" theme. This work is significant in that it is one of the earlier symphonic works and begins to establish the genre of the Symphony, which would then be expanded upon by Mozart and most Notably Hadyn, who is the \"Father of the Symphony\""

Though ska did not constitute a genre within the Christian music industry until after third wave ska had peaked in the general market, Christian ska continued to thrive independently into the early 2000s. Ska music came to be seen as \"an excellent vehicle for exhortation and praise due to its up front lyrical style\" and upbeat, energetic, joyful sound. While there were a large number of smaller bands, ska in the Christian marketplace in the late 1990s came to be primarily represented by three bands: The Insyderz, The O. C. Supertones, and Five Iron Frenzy; all of whom were commercially successful and ministry-oriented in their own right. As with third wave ska in the general market the sound was often intermingled with that of punk, swing, or rockabilly. In parallel with mainstream ska, many underground Christian ska bands released one or two ska based albums before completely genre-hopping away from ska or dissolving. Even the sounds of the \"big three\" tended to evolve. By 2002 one critic described the horn section of the Supertones as \"providing color instead of the dominant sound\".",

Disco during its dying stage displayed an increasingly electronic character that soon served as a stepping stone to new wave, hip-hop, euro disco, and was succeeded by an underground club music called hi-NRG, which was its direct continuation. An underground movement of disco music, \"stripped-down,\" and featuring \"radically different sounds\" took place on the East Coast that \"was neither disco and neither R&B,\" This scene known as post-disco catering to New York metropolitan area, was initially led by urban contemporary artists partially in response to over-commercialization and artistic downfall of disco culture. Developed from the rhythm and blues sound as perfected by Parliament-Funkadelic, the electronic side of disco, dub music techniques, and other genres. Post-disco was typified by New York City music groups like \"D\" Train and Unlimited Touch who followed a more urban approach while others, like Material and ESG, a more experimental one. Post-disco was, like disco, singles-driven market controlled mostly by independent record companies that generated a cross-over chart success all through the early-to-mid eighties decade. Most creative control was in the hands of record producers and club DJs which was a trend that outlived the dance-pop era. Other musical styles that emerged in the post-disco era include dance-pop, boogie, and Italo disco and led to the development of the early alternative dance, club-centered house, and techno music.",

In this case, \"Trionfo\" refers to the Roman and Renaissance trionfo, meaning \"procession\" or \"festival\". Like Igor Stravinsky's Les Noces, Trionfo di Afrodite describes rituals for a (in this case Greek-Roman) wedding. The texts are based on Latin wedding poems by Catullus, as well as Greek poems by Sappho and a small part by Euripides. Despite the large orchestra, the instrumentation is often sparse, especially in the Greek verses, and the music is strongly influenced by the rhythms and melodies of the spoken word, though little importance is actually given to both tonic and prosodic accent. The piece closes with a triumphant apparition of Aphrodite herself, a rare instance when the full choral and orchestral forces are actually used. Apart from the orchestra, the piece calls for five soloists (SSTTB) and a large mixed chorus."

Another Boogie-woogie is not strictly a solo piano style; it can accompany singers and be featured in orchestras and small combos. It is sometimes called \"eight to the bar\", as much of it is written in common time (4/4) time using eighth notes (quavers) (see time signature). The chord progressions are typically based on I - IV - V - I (with many formal variations of it, such as I/i - IV/iv - v/I, as well as chords that lead into these ones). For the most part, boogie-woogie tunes are twelve-bar blues, although the style has been applied to popular songs such as \"Swanee River\" and hymns such as \"Just a Closer Walk with Thee\".

The standard diatonic harmonica is designed to allow a player to play chords and melody in a single key. Because they are only designed to be played in a single key at a time, diatonic harmonicas are available in all keys. Harps labeled G through B start (on hole 1 blow) below middle C, while Harps labeled D♭ through F# start above middle C (C4). Here is the layout for a standard diatonic harmonica, labeled C, starting on middle C (C4). Although there are 3 octaves between 1 and 10 \"blow\", there is only one full major scale available on the harmonica, between holes 4 and 7. The lower holes are designed around the tonic (C major) and dominant (G major) chords, allowing a player to play these chords underneath a melody by blocking or unblocking the lower holes with the tongue. The most important notes (the tonic triad C–E–G) are given the blow, and the secondary notes (B-D-F–A), the draw."

Often the term was also used as a title for collections of music, some of which was intended to be so used. The function was displaced in the late 18th century by the divertimento, and its importance soon diminished, but it was revived and partially restored in the vocal genre of the Liedertafel by Carl Friedrich Zelter beginning in 1809, and male-voice choral societies describing themselves by this name continued the practice until the mid-20th century. Some of the most significant composers of Tafelmusik included Johann Schein, whose Banchetto musicale of 1617 acquired considerable fame, and Michael Praetorius, who wrote about the phenomenon of Tafelmusik in his Syntagma musicum of 1619. Music from Schein's collection is still performed by early music ensembles with some regularity. The Tafelmusik or Musique de Table by the Baroque composer Georg Philipp Telemann is perhaps his most celebrated collection of music. Composed in 1733, Telemann's Tafelmusik has been compared as a collection to the renowned Brandenburg concertos of Johann Sebastian Bach in clearly demonstrating the composer’s supreme skill in handling a diversity of musical genres and a variety of instruments.[citation needed] Tafelmusik could be either instrumental, vocal, or both. As might be expected, it was often of a somewhat lighter character than music for other occasions."

      "description": "The Violin Sonata No. 2 in A major, Op. 100 (\"Thun\" or \"Meistersinger\"), by Johannes Brahms was written while spending the summer of 1886 in Thun in the Bernese Oberland, Switzerland. It was a very fertile and refreshing time for Brahms. His friend the Swiss pastor and poet Josef Victor Widmann (1842–1911) lived in Berne and they visited each other. He was also visited by the poet Klaus Groth and the young German contralto Hermine Spies. Both Groth and Brahms were somewhat enamoured of Spies. He found himself so invigorated by the genial atmosphere and surroundings that he said the area was \"so full of melodies that one has to be careful not to step on any\". In a short space of time, he produced, in addition to this violin sonata, the Cello Sonata No. 2 in F major, Op. 99, the Piano Trio No. 3 in C minor, Op. 101, and various songs. The 2nd Violin Sonata is the shortest and is considered the most lyrical of Brahms's three violin sonatas. It is also considered the most difficult of the three to bring off successfully, and to exhibit its balance of lyricism and virtuosity. It maintains a radiant, happy mood throughout. It consists of three movements, with the middle movement doing service as both a slow movement and a scherzo: By giving the work the formal title of \"Sonata for Piano and Violin\", rather than the more usual \"Sonata for Violin and Piano\", Brahms indicated the piano part was just as important as the violin part. In keeping with this, he allowed the piano to announce the opening theme. The first three notes of the first movement are very similar in both melody and harmony to the first three notes of \"Walther's Prize Song\" (Morgenlich leuchtend im rosigen Schein) from Richard Wagner's opera Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg. Although they were musical rivals, Brahms was a great admirer of Wagner's music, but whether this was a deliberate quotation on Brahms's part is open to speculation. Nevertheless, the sonata has often been subtitled the \"Meistersinger\" Sonata. It is also sometimes called the \"Thun\" Sonata from the place of its creation. Motives from three of the songs Brahms wrote that summer with Hermine Spies's voice in mind appear fleetingly in the sonata: \"Wie Melodien zieht es mir leise durch den Sinn\", Op. 105/1 (\"Like melodies it steals softly through my mind\"; words by Klaus Groth) makes an appearance in the second subject of the first movement. \"Immer leiser wird mein Schlummer\", Op. 105/2 (\"Ever gentle is my sleep\"; words by Hermann Lingg) and \"Auf dem Kirchhofe\", Op. 105/4 (words by Detlev von Liliencron) are quoted in the final movement. The song \"Komm bald\", Op. 97/5 (\"Come soon\"; words by Groth) is also said have provided thematic inspiration for the sonata. The Violin Sonata No. 2 was premiered in Vienna on 2 December 1886 by the violinist Joseph Hellmesberger, Sr. and Brahms himself at the piano. Brahms's friend the poet Josef Widmann later wrote a poem to be accompanied by the sonata."

Sometimes referred to by the nickname Tragische (\"Tragic\"), Mahler composed the symphony at what was apparently an exceptionally happy time in his life, as he had married Alma Schindler in 1902, and during the course of the work's composition his second daughter was born. This contrasts with the tragic, even nihilistic, ending of No. 6. Both Alban Berg and Anton Webern praised the work when they first heard it. Berg expressed his opinion of the stature of this symphony in a 1908 letter to Webern:"

Bands that broke through to the mainstream from local scenes across the world in the early 2000s included the Strokes, Interpol, the White Stripes, the Hives and the Vines, who were followed to commercial success by many established and new acts. By the end of the decade, most of the bands had broken up, moved on to other projects or were on hiatus, although some bands returned to recording and touring in the 2010s.",

      "description": "Technical death metal (sometimes called tech-death, progressive death metal)[dubious – discuss] is a musical subgenre of death metal that focuses on complex rhythms, riffs and song structures. Technical experimentation in death metal began in the late 1980s and early 1990s by bands such as Death, Atheist and Cynic. In 1990, Nocturnus released their debut album, The Key, which was followed by Sarcófago's third album, The Laws of Scourge, featuring a change in their musical style from black metal/thrash metal to technical death metal. Atheist's second album, Unquestionable Presence; Pestilence's third album, Testimony of the Ancients; and Death's fourth album, Human, were all released the very next year. Human and later Death albums have proven especially influential on later '90s technical death metal bands. In 1991, New York's grindcore-influenced Suffocation released their debut album Effigy of the Forgotten, which focused on pairing speed and brutality with a \"sophisticated\" sense of songwriting. The album subsequently became groundbreaking in the genre. Swedish band Edge of Sanity would move on to a more progressive and melodic style with their albums The Spectral Sorrows and Purgatory Afterglow, but when the band released the one song 40-minute album Crimson in 1996 and the 43-minute/9-part sequel Crimson II in 2003, they left an impact on later progressive/technical death metal bands. Another Swedish band Opeth are a highly important band to this subgenre with albums such as My Arms, Your Hearse, Still Life, and Blackwater Park all combining death metal with progressive rock.",

Acid house was essentially house music made with a specific sound, obtained by using very distinctive instruments created mainly by Roland, such as the TB-303 for bass and lead sounds, and the TR-909 and TR-808 for percussion. Acid specifically refers to the use of the Roland TB-303, or any other synthesizer designed to emulate its unique sound. While modern electronic instruments have memory banks of different sounds or patches, these machines had to be manually set by adjusting control knobs. The acid sound was obtained by either setting these controls to extreme parameters, or manipulating these controls in real-time as the track was being recorded, something record producers would call tweaking.",

      "description": "Noises, Sounds & Sweet Airs is a 1991 opera by Michael Nyman that began as an opera-ballet titled La Princesse de Milan choreographed by Karine Saporta. The libretto is William Shakespeare's The Tempest, as abridged by the composer. The title is derived from Caliban's line, \"This isle is full of noises, sounds, and sweet airs, which give delight and hurt not.\" It premiered in June 1991 in Hérouville-Saint-Clair, Calvados, France, with the L'Ensemble de Basse-Normandie conducted by Dominique Debart. Three members of Saporta's dance company provided the singing. The opera is scored for one soprano, one contralto, and one tenor, two saxophones, and orchestra. The three singers are not assigned roles on character lines. They are voices, \"carriers of text\", and two or three singers often sing the role of a single character at points in the opera, and no character is sung consistently by any one voice. As originally performed, the dancers portrayed the characters. Nyman's liner notes of the recording give no indication of how the opera could be staged dramatically without the dancers, even though which title is used is dependent upon whether dancers are utilized. The opera-only version, which premiered in 1993, also includes more of Shakespeare's text. Nyman and Saporta collaborated on Prospero's Books, Peter Greenaway's film version of The Tempest, and were interested in working further with the play. Nyman did not base his score on that he wrote for Prospero's Books, but began a new score from scratch, occasionally interpolating music from the previous score as is his wont. He chose not to set Ariel's songs or the Masque, which he had already set, but he allows for them to be interpolated into the opera. Some of the music, such as in \"The fringed curtains of thine eye advance\" and \"Ye elves\" are known to be derived from La Traversée de Paris. The instrumental piece that became \"Ye elves\" is retitled \"Miranda Previsted\" on The Very Best of Michael Nyman: Film Music 1980-2001."

As Paul Tanner, Maurice Gerow, and David Megill suggest \"the tonal sonorities of these conservative players could be compared to pastel colors, while the solos of [Dizzy] Gillespie and his followers could be compared to fiery red colors.\" The term cool started being applied to this music around 1953, when Capitol Records released the album Classics in Jazz: Cool and Quiet.

      "description": "Acid trance is a genre of trance music that emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s focusing on using the acid sound. The trademark sound of \"acid\" is produced with a Roland TB-303 by playing a sequenced melody while altering the instrument's filter cutoff frequency, resonance, envelope modulation, and accent controls. This real-time tone adjustment was not part of the instrument's original intended operation. Acid trance is the best known form of trance music in Belgium. The form was first showcased at the popular Antwerp Rave 24 in Belgium, and has created four national number one singles in the country since.[citation needed] Acid trance may be considered a descendant of acid house, since the genre of trance had not yet been invented during the advent of acid house (or acidhouse).[citation needed] The first volumes of Trancemaster compilations contains a few tracks in acid trance style, just as classic trance tracks. The difference is, while acid trance tracks focus more on the changing TB-303 lines, classic trance (e.g. Dance 2 Trance, Cosmic Baby, Age of Love, and Jam & Spoon) tracks are more atmospheric, they use \"softer\" synth-lines, often stings and other ambient music elements. The line between these two styles is quite blurred; they also emerged about the same time.[citation needed] Acid Trance artists are often grouped with their classical and Goa counterparts. It is not uncommon to see many of the first Acid Trance artists featured on Goa Trance compilation albums. However, some of these artists[who?] never considered themselves part of the Goa or Psychedelic scene and these compilation albums were often done by their record labels who published Acid Trance alongside Goa artists.[citation needed]",

The term may also reference a putative journey undertaken by traditional African music from its homeland to the United States and back. Some scholars and ethnomusicologists have speculated that the origins of the blues can be traced to the musical traditions of Africa, as retained by African-Americans during and after slavery. Even though the blues is a key component of American popular music, its rural, African-American origins are largely undocumented, and its stylistic links with African instrumental traditions are somewhat tenuous. One musical influence that can be traced back to African sources is that of the plantation work songs with their call-and-response format, and more especially the relatively free-form field hollers of the later share croppers, which seem to have been directly responsible for the characteristic vocal style of the blues. Albums such as African Blues by Ali Farka Toure have a noticeable African and American Blues influence.[clarify] The death of Malian guitar legend Ali Farka Touré has inspired a new round of speculation about the roots of the blues in Africa. Touré famously argued that the beloved American genre was \"nothing but African,\" a bold assertion. The question has received extensive scholarly attention in Gerhard Kubik's book Africa and the Blues, and in Paul Oliver's Savannah Syncopators: African Retentions in the Blues.",

According to Christian Dornbusch and Hans-Peter Killguss, the writers of the book Unheilige Allianzen, völkisch pagan metal and neo-Nazism are the current trends in the Black Metal scene, and in turn are affecting the broader metal scene.

Similar to hip hop, sampling often serves a prominent role in raggamuffin music. In the mid-1980s, French Antilles Kassav, the first in the Caribbean to use MIDI technology, took Caribbean music to another level by recording in a digital format. Wayne Smith's \"Under Mi Sleng Teng\" was produced by King Jammy in 1985 on a Casio MT-40 synthesizer and is generally recognized as the seminal ragga song. \"Sleng Teng\" boosted Jammy's popularity immensely, and other producers quickly released their own versions of the riddim, accompanied by dozens of different vocalists. Ragga is now mainly used as a synonym for dancehall reggae or for describing dancehall with a deejay chatting rather than singjaying or singing on top of the riddim.",

The mournful, period song tells the tale of a young shepherd boy named Corydon who died. Governor William Henry Harrison of the Indiana Territory would visit frequently the land the area that would become Corydon. He owned 400 acres (1.6 km2) in present day Harrison County, even the land on which the Corydon Capitol building was built on. According to the story, Governor Harrison was at the house of Edward Smith, a friend of his. Governor Harrison said, he was planning on establishing a town in the area, but he had no thought of a name to call it yet. Edward's daughter Jennie suggested the name \"Corydon\" after his favorite song that she sang to him whenever he visited there. He said, \"I shall do so\" and thus the Town of Corydon was born. Words of the Pastoral Elegy (1st stanza): \"What sorrowful sounds do I hear,Move slowly along in the gale,How solemn they fall on my ear,As softly they pass through the vale.Sweet Corydon's notes are all o'er,Now lonely he sleeps in the clay,His cheeks bloom with roses no more,Since death called his spirit away.\""

      "description": "'Neurofunk' (also known more simply and informally as just 'Neuro') is a subgenre of drum and bass which emerged between 1997 and 1998 in London, England as a progression of techstep. It was further developed by juxtaposed elements of heavier and harder forms of funk with multiple influences ranging from techno, house and jazz, distinguished by consecutive stabs over the bassline and razor-sharp backbeats. The first sounds of neurofunk's early evolution - when diverging from techstep - can be heard on Ed Rush and Optical's Funktion single for V Recordings and on their first album Wormhole LP for Virus Recordings in 1998. The first mention of the term was in the book Energy Flash: A Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture by Simon Reynolds. This is where the English music critic coined the name as a result of his personal perception of stylistic shifts in techstep - back beats replacing breakbeats, funk harmonies replacing industrial timbres and lack of emphasis on the drop - by referring to them as, \"(Neurofunk) is the fun-free culmination of jungle's strategy of cultural resistance: the eroticization of anxiety\".",

      "description": "Trial by Jury is a comic opera in one act, with music by Arthur Sullivan and libretto by W. S. Gilbert. It was first produced on 25 March 1875, at London's Royalty Theatre, where it initially ran for 131 performances and was considered a hit, receiving critical praise and outrunning its popular companion piece, Jacques Offenbach's La Périchole. The story concerns a \"breach of promise of marriage\" lawsuit in which the judge and legal system are the objects of lighthearted satire. Gilbert based the libretto of Trial by Jury on an operetta parody that he had written in 1868. The opera premiered more than three years after Gilbert and Sullivan's only previous collaboration, Thespis, an 1871–72 Christmas season entertainment. In the intervening years, both the author and composer were busy with separate projects. Beginning in 1873, Gilbert tried several times to get the opera produced before the impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte suggested that he collaborate on it with Sullivan. Sullivan was pleased with the piece and promptly wrote the music. As with most Gilbert and Sullivan operas, the plot of Trial by Jury is ludicrous, but the characters behave as if the events were perfectly reasonable. This narrative technique blunts some of the pointed barbs aimed at hypocrisy, especially of those in authority, and the sometimes base motives of supposedly respectable people and institutions. These themes became favourites of Gilbert through the rest of his collaborations with Sullivan. Critics and audiences praised how well Sullivan's witty and good-humoured music complemented Gilbert's satire. The success of Trial by Jury launched the famous series of 13 collaborative works between Gilbert and Sullivan that came to be known as the Savoy Operas. After its original production in 1875, Trial by Jury toured widely in Britain and elsewhere and was frequently revived and recorded. It also became popular as a part of charity benefits. The work continues to be frequently played, especially as a companion piece to other short Gilbert and Sullivan operas or other works. According to theatre scholar Kurt Gänzl, it is \"probably the most successful British one-act operetta of all time\"."

The work, which was dedicated to the Russian/Polish cellist Count Mateusz Wielhorski, has four movements: A typical performance lasts 25 minutes. Of particular interest is the Adagio, because it mirrors Mendelssohn's fascination with the music of J. S. Bach. (He was then musical director of the Gewandhaus concerts at Leipzig and, as such, Bach's distant successor.) The movement consists of a chorale in Bach's typical style, played by the piano in rich arpeggios. In between the phrases of the chorale, the cello plays recitative-like passages, which resemble the recitative of the Fantasia in the Chromatic Fantasia and Fugue, BWV 903, and quotes its final passage."

      "description": "Marabi is a style of township music that evolved in South Africa over the last century. The early part of the 20th century saw the increasing urbanisation of black South Africans in mining centres such as the gold mining area around Johannesburg - the Witwatersrand. This led to the development of township slums or ghettos, and out of this hardship came forth new forms of music, marabi and kwela amongst others. Marabi was the name given to a keyboard style (often using cheap pedal organs) that had a musical link to American jazz, ragtime and blues, with roots deep in the African tradition. Early marabi musicians were part of an underground musical culture and were typically not recorded. Indeed, as with early jazz in the USA, the music incurred the displeasure of the establishment. Nonetheless, as with early jazz, the lilting melodies and catchy rhythms of marabi found their way into the sounds of popular dance bands with a distinctively South African style. The sound of marabi was intended to draw people into local bars or \"shebeens\" (where illicit drinks like skokiaan were sold), and to get them dancing. \"Shebeens\" resemble the American speakeasies of the prohibition era where American Jazz was very popular. Marabi is characterised by a few simple chords repeated in varying vamping patterns that could go on for a long time; repetitive harmonic patterns being typical of traditional African musics. This was the case so people could dance for extended periods of time without having to know the songs well. People were able to pick up the feel and rhythm of the song after a few times through the progression. The most famous of marabi's venues were the shebeens, and the weekend-long slumyard parties. For almost everyone outside ghetto life, however, marabi and its subculture were shunned. Associated with illegality, police raids, sex and a desperately impoverished working class, marabi was thought of as a corrupting menace and for this reason, it is no surprise that no early marabi musicians were recorded. A reflection of this music can be heard in the music of such Cape Jazz performers as Basil Coetzee or Abdullah Ibrahim. The beginnings of broadcast radio intended for black listeners and the growth of an indigenous recording industry helped propel such sounds to immense popularity from the 1930s onward. Such bands produced the first generation of professional black musicians in South Africa. Over the years, marabi developed into early mbaqanga, arguably the most distinctive form of South African music. This has which has influenced South African music since then, from the jazz performers of the post-war years to the more populist township forms of the 1980s and onwards. With the infusion of more traditional influences, marabi has lost much of its links to the styles jazz roots and is now part of the African music culture as opposed to South African Jazz. One of the most notable musical pieces that contain a hint of Marabi is Paul Simon's 1986 epic, Graceland. The Garland Encyclopedia of Music says, \"Fundamental to much of the musical mix (of Graceland) was the influence of the African-American jazz, introduced into South Africa by transnational record-distribution networks in the 1920s. Most South African jazz musicians could not read scores, so they developed their own jazz flavor, mixing american swing with african melodies. The dynamic blend of african-american structure and african style became the basis for early south african township jazz known as marabi.\"",

It is meant to give a sense of the personality of the character. Character songs are considered an important part of an anime or dorama's success, as they often provide insights to a character that may otherwise go unexplored on the program itself. The series' creators may also include details about a particular character's design stages and evolution, and on occasion even design sketches so fans can see for themselves how a character changed. There may also be comments from the voice actors or actors on how they feel about playing their characters. Sometimes character songs are incorporated into the anime itself, such as Kyōran Kazoku Nikki, which has each of its main characters sing an character song as the ending theme, each with its own animation. Another example is Prince of Tennis, which has the openings and ending songs for the OVA episodes sung by characters in the anime. Character songs are not restricted to anime protagonists. Antagonists such as Zechs Merquise, Master Asia, Sailor Galaxia, and some of the villains (such as Devimon and Sōsuke Aizen) also have their own character songs. In some cases, these are regarded as more interesting than those of the protagonists as they often provide the only glimpse into a villain's character. In addition, fans are known to buy character song albums based solely on the voice actor or actor. An example of this is Megumi Hayashibara, a well-known voice actress who has released many CDs and albums over her career, including character songs of her characters. The first anime character song album to reach No. 1 in the Japanese Oricon weekly charts is Hōkago Tea Time (放課後ティータイム After School Tea Time), performed by the characters from K-On! in 2009, debuting at No. 1 with the sales of 67,000 copies in its first week. The K-On! characters later became the first anime image group to reach No. 1 in the Oricon singles chart in 2010, with the opening theme for the second season of the show, \"Go! Go! Maniac!\", which debuted at No. 1 with the sales of over 83,000 copies in its first week."

As musicologist Roger Parker notes, the composer \"intervened on several important points, insisting for example that the role of Ernani be sung by a tenor (rather than by a contralto as had originally been planned). Ernani was first performed on 9 March 1844 and it was \"immensely popular, and was revived countless times during its early years\".

Although written three decades after the war, it now seems that it was this song that helped us to gain the victory\"."

      "description": "Der Graf von Luxemburg (The Count of Luxembourg) is an operetta in three acts by Franz Lehár to a German libretto by Alfred Willner, Robert Bodanzky, and Leo Stein. A Viennese take on bohemian life in Paris at the beginning of the 20th century, the story revolves around an impoverished aristocrat and a glamorous opera singer who have entered into a sham marriage without ever seeing each other and later fall in love at first sight, unaware that they are already husband and wife. It premiered at the Theater an der Wien, in Vienna, on 12 November 1909 and was an immediate success, being revived in Germany and translated into other languages for successful foreign productions including in France as Le comte de Luxembourg and in English-speaking countries as The Count of Luxembourg. It has remained in the repertory until the present day, especially in German-speaking countries, and several film and stage adaptations have been produced. The piece was recorded with the original Viennese cast and has since been recorded in several languages."

      "description": "Mala Pasqua! (Bad Easter!) is an opera in three acts composed by Stanislao Gastaldon to a libretto by Giovanni Domenico Bartocci-Fontana. The libretto is based on Giovanni Verga's play, Cavalleria rusticana (Rustic Chivalry) which Verga had adapted from his short story of the same name. Mala Pasqua! premiered on 9 April 1890 at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome, six weeks before Pietro Mascagni's opera Cavalleria rusticana which was also based on Verga's play. Bartocci-Fontana's libretto adds some elements that were not in Verga's original and expands on others. The name of the Santuzza character was also changed to Carmela, but the basic plot and setting remain the same. Its title refers to the curse which Carmela places on Turiddu, the lover who had spurned her: \"Mala Pasqua a te!\" (\"May you have an evil Easter!\"). Following its Rome premiere Mala Pasqua! had a few more performances in Perugia and Lisbon, but it was completely eclipsed by the phenomenal success of Mascagni's opera. After the 1891 Lisbon run it was not heard again until 2010 when it was given a semi-staged performance in Agrigento, Sicily."

      "description": "The Piano Sonata No. 1 in C major, Op. 1, of Johannes Brahms was written in Hamburg in 1853, and published later that year. Despite being his first published work, he had actually composed his second piano sonata first, but chose this work to be his first published opus because he felt that it was of higher quality. The piece was sent along with his second sonata to Breitkopf & Härtel with a letter of recommendation from Robert Schumann. Schumann had already praised Brahms enthusiastically, and the sonata shows signs of an effort to impress in its technical demands and dramatic character. It was dedicated to Joseph Joachim. The sonata is in four movements: The first movement is in conventional sonata form with a repeated exposition. The opening of the first theme resembles the opening of Beethoven's \"Hammerklavier\" sonata. The second movement is a theme and variations inspired by the song Verstohlen geht der Mond auf. Brahms was to rewrite it for female chorus in 1859 (WoO 38/20). The third movement is a scherzo and trio. The fourth is a loose rondo whose theme is noticeably changed at every recurrence."

      "description": "Hardbag is a genre of electronic dance music popular in the mid-1990s. Having evolved out of the handbag house scene in 1993-1994, the genre enjoyed massive, albeit brief, popularity, with several hardbag releases achieving positions in the upper echelons of the UK chart. It was at the time sometimes confused with Nu-NRG, yet the styles were discernibly different. \"Don't You Want Me\" by Felix is largely considered to be the track that launched the hardbag explosion. Produced by Rollo Armstrong of Faithless, Red Jerry and Felix, \"Don't You Want Me\" was released in 1992, scoring a Top 10 placing on the UK singles chart. The popularity of the hardbag genre reached its zenith in 1995 with releases by Commander Tom, Candy Girls, Rollo & Sister Bliss and Mrs Wood all crossing over into the mainstream. Indeed, the sound began to meld with mákina, evident on tracks such as \"Forever Young\" by Interactive and \"Rainbow Islands\" - Seb. The two most influential exponents of the sound were Dutch producer Patrick Prins (who, recording a variety of aliases, scored several large UK club and chart hits such as \"Bits & Pieces\" - Artemesia) and the late Tony De Vit, whose hardbag composition \"Hooked\" is still considered one of the definitive examples of the genre. Another great presence in the hardbag scene was Red Jerry, former head of Hooj Choons. Other influential producers include Sister Bliss and Paul Masterson, the latter of whom diversified hardbag remixes to incorporate Hi-NRG elements. By early 1997 the Hardbag craze had died down, and the sound began evolving into what was eventually to become known as UK hard house. Labels such as Tripoli Trax expounded this sound via releases such as \"Bells Of Revolution\" by Lemon 8 and \"Raise Your Hands\" by Knuckleheadz.",

      "description": "The New Wave of British Heavy Metal (commonly abbreviated in NWOBHM) was a nationwide musical movement that started in the late 1970s in the United Kingdom and achieved international attention by the early 1980s. The term was first used by journalist Geoff Barton in the May 1979 issue of the British music newspaper Sounds, as a way of describing the emergence of new heavy metal bands in the late 1970s, during the period of punk rock's decline and the dominance of new wave music. The New Wave of British Heavy Metal began as an underground phenomenon parallel to punk and largely ignored by the media, which, only through the promotion of rock DJ Neal Kay and Sounds' campaigning, reached the public consciousness and gained radio coverage, recognition and success in the UK. The movement involved mostly young, white, male and working class musicians and fans, who suffered the hardships of the diffuse unemployment condition that hit Great Britain for years after the 1973–75 recession. As a reaction, they created a community separated from mainstream society where to enjoy each other's company and their favourite loud music. It evolved in a new subculture with its own behavioural and visual codes and a shared set of values, which were quickly accepted by metal fans worldwide following the almost immediate diffusion of the music in the US, Europe and Japan. Although fragmented in a collection of different styles, the music of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal is best remembered for drawing from the heavy metal of the 70s and fusing it with the intensity of punk rock, producing fast and aggressive songs. The DIY attitude of the new metal bands caused the diffusion of raw-sounding self-produced recordings and the proliferation of independent record labels. The song lyrics were usually about typically escapist themes, like mythology, fantasy, horror and rock lifestyle. The movement spawned about a thousand metal bands, but only a few survived the advent of MTV and the rise of the more commercial glam metal in the second half of the 80s. Among them, only Iron Maiden and Def Leppard became international stars, although Motörhead and Saxon also had considerable success. Other groups, like Diamond Head, Venom and Raven, remained underground acts, but were a major influence for the very successful extreme metal subgenres of the late-80s and 90s. Many bands from the New Wave of British Heavy Metal reformed in the 2000s and are still active with live performances and new studio albums.",

Early performances of the piece were made by students at Kyiv University. \"Shchedryk\" was later adapted as an English Christmas carol, \"Carol of the Bells\", by Peter J. Wilhousky following a performance of the original song by Alexander Koshetz's Ukrainian National Chorus at Carnegie Hall on October 5, 1921. Wilhousky copyrighted and published his new lyrics (which were not based on the Ukrainian lyrics) in 1936, and the song became popular in the United States, where it became strongly associated with Christmas."

      "description": "Roberto Devereux (or Roberto Devereux, ossia Il conte di Essex [Robert Devereux, or the Earl of Essex]) is a tragedia lirica, or tragic opera, by Gaetano Donizetti. Salvadore Cammarano wrote the Italian libretto after François Ancelot's tragedy Elisabeth d'Angleterre (1829), and based as well on the Historie secrete des amours d'Elisabeth et du comte d'Essex (1787) by Jacques Lescéne des Maisons, although Devereux was the subject of at least two other French plays: Le Comte d'Essex by Thomas Corneille and Le Comte d'Essex by Gauthier de Costes, seigneur de la Calprenède. The opera is loosely based on the life of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, an influential member of the court of Queen Elizabeth I of England. The plot of Roberto Devereux was hardly original, mainly derived from Felice Romani's libretto Il Conte d'Essex of 1833, originally set by Saverio Mercadante. Romani's widow charged Cammarano with plagiarism, although the practice of stealing plots was very common between rival Italian opera houses. It is one of a number of operas by Donizetti which deal with the Tudor period in English history and include Anna Bolena (named for Henry VIII's second wife, Anne Boleyn), Maria Stuarda (named for Mary, Queen of Scots) and Il castello di Kenilworth. The lead female characters of the operas Anna Bolena, Maria Stuarda, and Elisabetta are often referred to as the \"Three Donizetti Queens.\" They earned some degree of fame in the 1970s, when the American soprano Beverly Sills promoted them as a series at New York City Opera. It has been noted that, \"although the plot plays fast and loose with history, the opera carries its own brand of dramatic conviction\"."

      "description": "The Symphony in G minor was Édouard Lalo’s final original orchestral composition. It was composed in 1885-1886. (There were two earlier symphonies composed by Lalo, believed destroyed). It was premiered on 7 February 1887 in Paris at the Concerts Lamoureux under Charles Lamoureux. It is a classically constructed romantic symphony with the composer’s Latin roots present in the melodies and orchestration. There are four movements with 28 minutes duration: Instrumentation is two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani and strings. The full score was published by G. Hartmann in 1888, and brought out as a Heugel et Cie imprint in 1900 as plate 1820 (Heugel having purchased Hartmann in 1891). Xavier Leroux also made a four hand piano version, published by Heugel as plate 1795. In a 7 March 1887 letter responding for information on the symphony to author and Wagner enthusiast Adolphe Jullien, Lalo stated his belief in pure music over descriptive music: “It appears that you personally wish to have some information regarding the thought which predominates in my symphony. Alas, I am going to scandalize you! I had no literary thought in the sense that you mean. When I write a composition to words, I become a slave to what convention terms the verities of musical expression, according to a given text. But when I write music without a literary text, I have before and about me only the domain of sounds, melodic and harmonic. For a musician, this immense field possesses in itself, aside from all literature, its poems and its dramas. As to my Symphony, I have presented the master phrase in a brief introduction, as you have been kind enough to remark; it predominates in the first movement, and I recall it in the others whenever my poetic or dramatic musical intentions (do not laugh!) make its intervention seem necessary to me”. Lalo’s symphony was called one of the \"happiest\" of French symphonies in a 1925 article in The Musical Quarterly. Lalo’s is from the same period that produced three other notable French symphonies: Saint-Saëns Symphony No. 3 \"Organ Symphony\", d'Indy’s Symphony on a French Mountain Air, and Franck’s Symphony in D minor. Lalo's work was neglected until Thomas Beecham \"discovered\" it and conducted it regularly. In the United States, only the New York Philharmonic amongst major symphony orchestras performed the work up to 1970 (that sole performance being in 1931). A 1961 review of the first major recording (Beecham’s made in 1959 at the Salle Wagram in Paris) disparaged the composition as \"not very rewarding. Both matter and manner are dull and undistinguished, without the sparkle and melodic charm of the popular Symphonie Espagnole\". A 1976 review of Antonio de Almeida’s recording suggests that \"the cyclic theme does bear an unfortunately close resemblance to the opening of the Brahms B-flat Piano Concerto, in a way that Lalo surely did not intend\". This review finds the second movement the most cohesive of the four and \"wonderfully scored\", suggesting Bizet's Symphony in C as the \"closest equivalent\"."

Often considered darker and gloomier than visual kei, nagoya kei takes its musical influences more so from western (specifically British) punk rock bands. The focus of the bands tends to be much less on costume and makeup in favor of more complex musical compositions and concentration on the music itself. Notable nagoya kei bands include Silver~Rose, Laputa, Fanatic Crisis, Kuroyume and Merry Go Round. Bands such as Kein, Lamiel, Phobia, Deadman, Blast, Gullet, The Studs, Deathgaze and Lynch. appeared in the Nagoya area later on, but since the term Visual kei had already become mainstream by then, these bands are generally not considered part of Nagoya kei.

Pierpoint was 29 at the time he wrote this hymn; he was mesmerised by the beauty of the countryside that surrounded him. It first appeared in 1864 in a book of Eucharistic Hymns and Poems entitled \"Lyra Eucharistica, Hymns and Verses on The Holy Communion, Ancient and Modern, with other Poems.\" It was written as a Eucharistic hymn - hence the title of \"The Sacrifice of Praise\", the refrain \"Christ, our God, to Thee we raise, This, our sacrifice of praise\", and as is seen throughout the original text of 1864, especially the last two lines which had replaced the Refrain in verse 8. This is how it appears in the 'English Hymnal' of 1933, with the two exceptions, that Pierpoint's last two lines which had replaced the Refrain after verse 8, were omitted and the Refrain sung instead, and the first two words of the last line in verse two \"sinking sense\", in common with all other hymnbooks was modified to \"linking sense\". The text was more radically modified by the publishers of \"Hymns Ancient and Modern\" for the 1916 Hymnbook, so it could serve as a general hymn. The tune most widely used for this hymn is the same tune used for William Chatterton Dix's \"As with Gladness, Men of Old,\" a Christmas carol composed five years prior but not released publicly until three years after Pierpont. (Although the tune is known traditionally as \"Dix\" in deference to William Dix, it was originally composed by Conrad Kocher in 1838.) Other tunes used are: \"Warden\" by James Turle (1802-1882) - as appeared in the 1916 Hymns A&M Standard, and \"England’s Lane\" by Geoffrey Turton Shaw (1879–1943) as it appeared in the English Hymnal."

Being vocal groups, most boy band members do not play musical instruments, either in recording sessions or on stage, making the term something of a misnomer. However, exceptions do exist. Many boy bands dance as well as sing, usually giving highly choreographed performances. Some such bands form on their own. They can evolve out of church choral or gospel music groups, but are often created by talent managers or record producers who hold auditions. Due to this and their general commercial orientation towards a female audience of preteens, teenyboppers, or teens, the term may be used with negative connotations in music journalism. Boy bands are similar in concept to their counterparts, girl groups. Boy bands' popularity peaked thrice: in the 1960s (e.g., the Monkees and the Four Seasons), in the 1990s and early 2000s when acts such as the Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, and Westlife, among others, dominated the top of the Billboard and pop charts, and in the early 2010s with the emergence of new boy bands such as JLS, Big Time Rush, One Direction and The Wanted",

Other influece taken from reggae include harmonic accentuation of the offbeats, however off-beat rhythms can sometimes be layered on top of more traditional dubstep or ragga melodies.

      "description": "The Sorcerer is a two-act comic opera, with a libretto by W. S. Gilbert and music by Arthur Sullivan. It was the British duo's third operatic collaboration. The plot of The Sorcerer is based on a Christmas story, An Elixir of Love, that Gilbert wrote for The Graphic magazine in 1876. A young man, Alexis, is obsessed with idea of love levelling all ranks and social distinctions. To promote his beliefs, he invites the proprietor of J. W. Wells & Co., Family Sorcerers, to brew a love potion. This causes everyone in the village to fall in love with the first person they see and results in the pairing of comically mismatched couples. In the end, Wells must sacrifice his life to break the spell. The opera opened on 17 November 1877 at the Opera Comique in London, where it ran for 178 performances. It was considered a success by the standards of that time and encouraged the collaborators to write their next opera, H.M.S. Pinafore. The Sorcerer was revised for an 1884 revival, and it is in that version that it is usually performed today. The Sorcerer was the first Savoy opera for which the author and composer had nearly total control over the production and the selection of cast. Several of the actors chosen went on to create principal roles in most of the later Gilbert and Sullivan operas. It was their first opera to use all the major character types and typical range of songs that would appear in their later collaborations, such as comic duets, a patter song, a contrapuntal double chorus, a tenor and soprano love duet, a soprano showpiece and so forth. The modest success of The Sorcerer was overshadowed by the extraordinary popularity of Gilbert and Sullivan's later collaborations, and the opera remains one of the team's less popular ones. The satire in the piece concerns Victorian-era class distinctions and operatic conventions with which modern audiences are less familiar. Nevertheless, the opera was important to the development of the Gilbert and Sullivan collaboration and is still regularly played."

The symphony is scored for two oboes, two horns and strings. In contemporary orchestras, it was also usual to include bassoons and harpsichord if they were available in the orchestra to reinforce the bass line and act as the continuo. The duration is approximately 13 minutes. elative c' { } The symphony consists of the following movements: Unusually, the minuet and trio is the second rather than the usual third movement. Like other works from this time period, such as the K. 97 symphony, the autograph, which was in the possession of Breitkopf & Härtel, was destroyed during World War II. Mozart's authorship therefore remains uncertain. Most professionals consider the work authentic. The Alte Mozart-Ausgabe (published 1879–82) gives the numbering sequence 1–41 for the 41 numbered symphonies. The unnumbered symphonies (some, including K. 75, published in supplements to the Alte-Mozart Ausgabe until 1910) are sometimes given numbers in the range 42 to 56, even though they were written earlier than Mozart's Symphony No. 41 (written in 1788). The symphony K. 75 is given the number 42 in this numbering scheme."

      "description": "L'Arianna (English: Ariadne) (SV 291), composed in 1607–1608, was the second opera by the Italian composer Claudio Monteverdi. One of the earliest operas, it was first performed on 28 May 1608, as part of the musical festivities for a royal wedding at the court of Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga in Mantua. All the music is lost apart from the extended recitative known as \"Lamento d'Arianna\" (\"Ariadne's Lament\"). The libretto, which survives complete, was written in eight scenes by Ottavio Rinuccini, who used Ovid's Heroides and other classical sources to relate the story of Ariadne's abandonment by Theseus on the island of Naxos and her subsequent elevation as bride to the god Bacchus. The opera was composed under severe pressure of time; the composer later said that the effort of creating it almost killed him. The initial performance, produced with lavish and innovative special effects, was highly praised, and the work was equally well received in Venice when it was revived under the composer's direction in 1640 as the inaugural work for the Teatro San Moisè. Rinuccini's libretto is available in a number of editions. The music of the \"Lamento\" survives because it was published by Monteverdi, in several different versions, independently from the opera. This fragment became a highly influential musical work and was widely imitated; the \"expressive lament\" became an integral feature of Italian opera for much of the 17th century. In recent years the \"Lamento\" has become popular as a concert and recital piece and has been frequently recorded. A new completion of the \"Lamento\", which includes a setting of the surviving texts of the choruses to new music by Scottish composer Gareth Wilson (b. 1976), was performed at King's College, London University, on 29 November 2013, the 370th anniversary of Monteverdi's death."

During the mid-20th century, mento was conflated with calypso, and mento was frequently referred to as calypso, kalypso and mento calypso. Mento singers frequently used calypso songs and techniques.

The work is in three movements, with the following tempo indications: It is tonal, but highly dissonant, using the piano in a percussive fashion. Underneath clusters of repeated notes, the melody is folk-like. Each movement has a classical structure overall, in character with Bartók's frequent use of classical forms as vehicles for his most advanced thinking. Musicologist Halsey Stevens finds in the work early forms of many stylistic traits that became more fully developed in Bartók's \"golden age\", 1934-1940. Bartók wrote Dittának, Budapesten, 1926, jun. at the end of the score. Ditta is the name of his second wife. A performance generally lasts around fifteen minutes. Bartók wrote the duration as ca. 12' 30\" on the score. Bartok wrote this piece with an Imperial Bösendorfer (piano) in mind, which has extra keys in the bass (97 keys in total). The 2nd movement of the sonata calls for these keys to be played. Bartók had previously written a piano sonata in 1896, which is little known."

      "description": "Folk rock is a musical genre combining elements of folk music and rock music. In its earliest and narrowest sense, the term referred to a genre that arose in the United States and the United Kingdom around the mid-1960s. The genre was pioneered by the Los Angeles band the Byrds, who began playing traditional folk music and songs by Bob Dylan with rock instrumentation, in a style heavily influenced by the Beatles and other British bands. The term \"folk rock\" was coined by the U.S. music press to describe the Byrds' music in June 1965, the month in which the band's debut album was issued. The release of the Byrds' cover version of Dylan's \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and its subsequent commercial success initiated the folk rock explosion of the mid-1960s. Dylan also contributed to the genre, particularly with his recordings with rock instrumentation on the albums Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited, and Blonde on Blonde. Dylan's appearance at the Newport Folk Festival on 25 July 1965, with an electric band backing him, was a pivotal moment in the development of folk rock. Antecedents of folk rock can be found in the American folk music revival, the beat music of the Beatles and other British Invasion bands, the Animals' hit recording of the folk song \"The House of the Rising Sun\", and the folk-influenced songwriting of the Beau Brummels. In particular, the folk influence evident in such Beatles' songs as \"I'm a Loser\" and \"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\" was influential on folk rock. The repertoire of most folk rock acts was drawn from folk sources and also from folk-influenced singer-songwriters such as Dylan. Musically, the genre was typified by clear vocal harmonies and a relatively \"clean\" (effects- and distortion-free) approach to electric instruments, as epitomized by the jangly 12-string guitar sound of the Byrds. This jangly guitar sound was derived from the music of the Searchers and from George Harrison's use of a Rickenbacker 12-string on the Beatles' recordings in 1964 and 1965. A distinct, eclectic style of electric folk was created in Britain and Europe in the late 1960s by Pentangle, Fairport Convention and Alan Stivell. Inspired by British psychedelic folk and the North American style of folk rock, Pentangle, Fairport, and other related bands began to incorporate elements of traditional British folk music into their repertoire. Fairport bassist Ashley Hutchings formed Steeleye Span with traditionalist folk musicians who wished to incorporate overt rock elements into their music, and this led to other variants, including the overtly English folk rock of the Albion Band (also featuring Hutchings) and the more prolific current of Celtic rock. In a broader sense, folk rock includes later similarly inspired musical genres and movements in the English-speaking world (and its Celtic and Filipino fringes) and, to a lesser extent, elsewhere in Europe. As with any genre, the borders are difficult to define. Folk rock may lean more toward folk or more toward rock in instrumentation, playing and vocal style, and choice of material; while the original genre draws on music of Europe and North America, there is no clear delineation of which folk cultures music might be included as influences. Still, the term is not usually applied to rock music rooted in the blues-based or other African American music (except as mediated through folk revivalists), nor to rock music with Cajun roots, nor to music (especially after about 1980) with non-European folk roots, which is more typically classified as world music.",

The twentieth century also saw a greater proliferation of sonatas for solo bassoon and sonatas for bassoon in various duets with other instruments (such as cello or oboe). Unless otherwise noted, the pieces below are for bassoon and piano."

Today most live in Oklahoma, but a minority continue in Florida. They have three federally recognized tribes, and some people belong to bands outside those groups. Their traditional music includes extensive use of rattles, bongos, and flutes. Seminole folk songs include those used to treat the sick and injured, and to encourage animals to be easily hunted. Hunting songs were a cappella and call-and-response. The two major ritual dances were the Green Corn Dance, held in June, and the Hunting Dance, held in October. Other informal dances were held throughout the year, with some specific dances only performed in either summer or winter. Many dances were connected with an animal spirit, such as the Snake, the Crawfish and the very important Alligator."

      "description": "The Symphony No. 1 in B-flat major, Op. 38, also known as the Spring Symphony, is the first symphonic work composed by Robert Schumann. Although he had made some \"symphonic attempts\" in the autumn of 1840 soon after he married Clara Wieck, he did not compose his First Symphony until early 1841. Schumann sketched the symphony in four days from 23 to 26 January and completed the orchestration by 20 February. The premiere took place under the baton of Felix Mendelssohn on 31 March 1841 in Leipzig, where the symphony was warmly received. Until this symphony, Schumann was largely known for his works for the piano and for voice. Clara encouraged him to write symphonic music. The title of \"Spring Symphony\" was bestowed upon it, according to Clara's diary, because of the Spring poems of Adolph Boettger. However, Schumann himself said he was merely inspired by his Liebesfrühling (spring of love). The last movement of the symphony also uses the final theme of Kreisleriana, and therefore recalls the romantic and fantastic inspiration of this piano composition. The symphony has four movements: The orchestration is for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns (2 in F, E-flat, and D, 2 in B-flat), 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, timpani, triangle and strings. Schumann especially expanded the use of timpani in this revolutionary piece. Schumann made some revisions until the definitive full-score of the symphony was published in 1853. The playing time of the symphony is about 29–31 minutes, depending upon the interpretation."

Handel had assembled a cast of operatic superstars for this season and the opera became an enormous success. The story of the opera is a fictionalisation of some events in the lives of Adalbert of Italy, his mother Willa of Tuscany (called \"Gismonda\" in the opera), Otto II, and the Byzantine Princess Theophanu, who became the wife of Otto II in a state marriage intended to form an alliance between the Byzantine and Holy Roman empires."

It is about twice the size of a regular (soprano) oboe and sounds an octave lower; it has a deep, full tone somewhat akin to that of its higher-pitched cousin, the English horn. The bass oboe is notated in the treble clef, sounding one octave lower than written. Its lowest note is B2 (in scientific pitch notation), one octave and a semitone below middle C, although an extension may be inserted between the lower joint and bell of the instrument in order to produce a low B♭2. The instrument's bocal or crook first curves away from and then toward the player (unlike the bocal/crook of the English horn and oboe d'amore), looking rather like a flattened metal question mark[citation needed]; another crook design resembles the shape of a bass clarinet neckpiece. The bass oboe uses its own double reed, similar to but larger than that of the English horn."

The opera received its premiere on 3 December 1948 at the Kirov Theatre, Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg). The audience was made up of Soviet cultural officials who gave the work a poor reception. This was a great disappointment to the composer who had intended the opera to rehabilitate his reputation with the Communist authorities after he had been accused of \"formalism\" earlier in the year. As a result, performances of The Story of a Real Man were forbidden to the general public until after Prokofiev's death.

      "description": "Jit (also known as jiti, jit-jive and the Harare beat) is a style of popular Zimbabwean dance music. It features a swift rhythm played on drums and accompanied by a guitar. Jit evolved out many diverse influences, including domestic chimurenga, Congolese rumba and Tanzanian guitar styles. The genre was popularized in the 1980s by bands like Chazezesa Challengers, The Four Brothers and Bhundu Boys. Jit is one of Zimbabwean fast beat, but there is a confusion between the more popular \"sungura\" which is said to be jit which was popularised by Chazezesa Challengers and many others including Alick macheso and Ochestra Mberikwazvo. Jit was popularised by Four Brothers fronted by Marshall Munhumumwe, Bhundu Boys fronted by late Biggy Tembo actual name\" Mhosva Marasha\" the most known name being his stage name.The likes of late James Chimombe, Paul Mpofu played jit. Paul Mpofu's all time hit \"Murambinda\" has out lived the test of time as it has become a wedding anthem used to celebrate so many a wedding. The Zimbabwean musicians who play jit are so many including the author Gibbs Chitate, Mr. Bulk \"Chiyangwa, Cephas Mashakada and the Muddy Face which also used to play with Job Mashanda the late,Andy Brown and the Storm some of his songs,[Charles Charamba]] and the Fishers of Man although he is a gospel singer his sound borders around jit, Paul Matavire only to mention but just a few.Gibbs Chitate fuses his beat with jazz riffs as jit and jazz bear the same name in other circles in Zimbabwe especially Murehwa where it is also known as jazz.Gibbs calls his type of jit \"Urban Jit\" due to its mellowness and soft tempo which comprises fused elements of calypso,country,and any other genre depending on the composition as a way to improve its appeal to the new generation as culture is always evolving.Jit music is originally played by people singing in a circle and playing to or singing with one or two drums called \"Mutumba\" and these drums are played in rhythm with each other and in sync with the song\" vocals\".One will be leading with the vocals and the rest will answer to the call and sometimes sing altogether in harmony, the lead vocalist may chant and the people answering will give the vocalist room to do all the adlibing before they answer. In the early 1970s there was a very popular group called \"Dzumbunu Choir\". This group used to play raw jit with the basic instruments of drum or drums and \"hosho\" jingles.Dzumbunu Choir was resident at Goromonzi or Arcturus area about sixty kilometres out of Harare on the North eastern side.As people sing they may use jingles or \"hosho\" shakers as African music is generally percussive. Jit is in nowadays mostly used in its raw content by political parties as a campaign vehicle due to its flexibility in acccomodating chants, singing,expressiveness and infectious tunes that are so catchy and easy to learn if a new song is introduced. It is very unfotunate that \"sungura has taken the fast paced tempo class of Zimbabwean music due to it having been promoted by record companies who seek commercialisation of sound as opposed to maintaining the social culture and tradition of a people. Sungura is a basterdised Kenyan rumba and the singing to a certain degree emulates the \"kanindo\" or East African rumba. Jit type of music is celebratory in its context when used socially either in marriage celebrations, success in games or bumper harvests and many others function of the society.The songs maybe satirical with a deep hidden meaning and a good selection of words of praise or counseling. Jit can be fused with a lot of different types of instruments such as,saxophone,flute even xylophones \"marimba\"and some would think it has crossed over to jazz.If one listens to James Chimombe's music one may wonder if he/she is not listening to Jazz music as it borders along that fine line. Jit music in the Northeastern part of Zimbabwe called Murehwa it is known as Jazz or \"Pfonda\" as mentioned earlier on. You will notice why it boarders along with Jazz. Jit can be played in slow beats or fast depending with the occasion. This type of sound is very versatile and exciting.The Zimbabwean master of song Oliver Mutukudzi has some of his songs in jit and Thomas Mapfumo as well. Jit is a highly danceable beat that commands the listener to dance and there are so many types of dances associated with it such as hwishu, tuwisti, kongonya, borodhero, honda, chipisi and many others. Bhorodhero is the most popular one due to it being popularised by Alick Macheso and System Tazvida's Chazezesa Challengers in their repetuers. The name bhorodhero is a derivative from a race course's name in Harare called Borrowdale race Course as the dance resembles a galloping horse.",

      "description": "Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky struggled with sonata form, the primary Western principle for building large-scale musical structures since the middle of the 18th century. Traditional Russian treatment of melody, harmony and structure actually worked against sonata form's modus operandi of movement, growth and development. Russian music—the Russian creative mentality as a whole, in fact—functioned on the principle of stasis. Russian novels, plays and operas were written as collections of self-contained tableaux, with the plots proceeding from one set-piece to the next. Russian folk music operated along the same lines, with songs comprised as a series of self-contained melodic units repeated continually. Compared to this mindset, the precepts of sonata form probably seemed as alien as if they had arrived from the moon. Sonata form also was not designed to accommodate the emotionally charged statements that Tchaikovsky wanted to make. In this, he was far from alone—it was a major preoccupation of the Romantic age, to the point that the validity of the symphony was questioned seriously and alternatives to it were actually devised. These alternatives, which included program music in general and the symphonic poem in particular, did not offer a complete solution. Instead, they left Tchaikovsky facing a paradox. He reportedly did not care for program music, to the point of reproaching himself for writing the fantasy-overture Romeo and Juliet. Yet the notion of writing symphonies as purely intellectual patterns of chords, rhythms and modulations was at least equally abhorrent. Nevertheless, Tchaikovsky attempted to adhere more closely at least to the manner of sonata form in his first three symphonies. They remain chronicles of his attempts to reconcile his training from the Saint Petersburg Conservatory with the music he had heard all his life and his own innate penchant for melody. Both those factors worked against sonata form, not with it. With the Fourth Symphony, Tchaikovsky hit upon a solution he would refine in his remaining two numbered symphonies and his program symphony Manfred—one that would enable to reconcile the more personal, more dramatic and heightened emotional statements he wished to make with the classical structure of the symphony, showing, as musicologist Martin Cooper phrased it, that \"his inspiration was stronger than scruple.\" Scrutability over Tchaikovsky's work, however, has remained intense at times, especially among critics. The fact that Tchaikovsky did not follow sonata form strictly and instead amended it creatively has been seen at times as a weakness rather than a sign of originality. Even with what music critic Harold C. Schonberg termed \"a professional reevaluation\" of Tchaikovsky's work, the practice of faulting Tchaikovsky for not following in the steps of the Viennese masters has not gone away entirely. More often than in the past, however, his approach is being viewed as innovative rather than evasive and an effective fusion of two dissimilar musical philosophies."

A bagad plays mainly Breton music, but a bagad's music is evolutionary: new forms and musical ideas are experimented with at each annual national competition. The plural for bagad is unusual in that many are referred to as bagadoù but for two, three or any other specified number they are simply referred to as bagad (following the rules of Breton grammar). Every major town and city in Brittany has at least one bagad and there are over eighty in total. There are also many bagadoù outside Brittany, owing to large-scale Breton emigration throughout France. Bagad Lann Bihoue is well known to belong to the French Navy. For competition purposes the bagadoù are ranked into five categories. Major competitions take place annually in Brest and in Lorient, where the National Championship takes place during the Inter-Celtic Festival in August.",

It combines elements of those genres with punk rock and pop music, adding catchy hooks and guitar riffs, while borrowing from the fashion of 1970s glam rock. The style can be traced back to acts like Aerosmith, the Alice Cooper group, Boston, Cheap Trick, Kiss, The New York Dolls, andVan Halen. It arose in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the United States, particularly on the Los Angeles Sunset Strip music scene, pioneered by bands such as Mötley Crüe, Quiet Riot, Def Leppard, Ratt and New Jersey band Bon Jovi. It was popular throughout the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, bringing to prominence bands including Poison, Cinderella, and Warrant. Glam metal was also associated with flashy clothing and makeup. Poison, for example, had long shaggy or backcombed hair, accessories, metal studs, leather and make-up during their live performances. The genre lost mainstream interest in the late 1980s as the perceived excesses of glam metal created a backlash against the genre. A factor in its decline was the rise of grunge in the early 1990s, which had a stripped-down aesthetic and a complete rejection of the glam metal visual style. It has enjoyed a revival since the beginning of the new millennium with reunions of many popular acts from the genre's 1980s heyday, as well as the retro styling of new bands including The Darkness from the UK and Steel Panther from Los Angeles.",

      "description": "New Mexico music is a genre of music that originated in New Mexico, United States, it derives from the Puebloan music in the 13th century, and its further development during the 16th to 19th centuries in Santa Fe de Nuevo México. The music went through several changes during pre-statehood, mostly during the developments of Western. After statehood, New Mexico music became a folk music for the native New Mexicans, mostly with the Pueblo, Navajo, Apache, Neomexicanos, and the descendants of the American frontier. Shortly after statehood, during the early 1900s, elements of Country music and American folk music began to become incorporated into the genre. The 1950s and 1960s brought the influences of Blues, Jazz, Rockabilly, and Rock and roll into New Mexico music; and, during the 1970s, the genre entered popular music in the state, with artists like Al Hurricane and Freddie Brown receiving airtime locally on KANW, and international recognition on the syndicated Val De La O Show. Also, prominently featured on the Val de la O Show were other Southwestern artists performing Regional Mexican and Tejano music, this brought a more general audience to New Mexico music. The sound of New Mexico music is distinguished by its steady rhythm, usually provided by drums or guitar, while accompanied by instruments common in Pueblo music, Western, Norteño, Apache music, Country, Ranchera, and Navajo music. Country and western music lend their drum and/or guitar style sections, while the steadiness of the rhythm owes its origins to the music of the Apache, Navajo, and Pueblo. And the differing rates of that tempo comes from the three common Ranchera rhythm speeds, the polka at 2/4 (ranchera polkeada), the waltz at 3/4 (ranchera valseada), and/or the bolero at 4/4 (bolero ranchero). The language of the vocals in New Mexico music is usually Spanish and New Mexican Spanish; American and New Mexican English; Spanglish; Tiwa; Hopi; Zuni; Navajo; and/or Southern Athabaskan languages. Outside of New Mexico, nationally and internationally, New Mexico music is classified under several different genres, including, World, Country, Latin, Reggae, and Folk. In Arizona, Colorado, Oklahoma, and Utah it is sometimes placed as a subgenre of Latin music, this is especially true in Arizona, Southern Colorado, and the Oklahoma panhandle. And, in Mexico and Texas, it is sometimes classified as Norteño or Ranchera.",

The work was commissioned for television by the NBC Opera Theatre and uses an English language libretto by the composer. Unlike Menotti's previous television operas, such as Amahl and the Night Visitors, this opera was written with no intention of being moved to live stage performance later. Menotti intended for this work to utilize the special effects unique to television which could not be recreated in live theatre. As a result, NBC's television production of the opera is the only performance the work has received. At its premiere in March 1963 the opera was mainly criticized by the press for its trite use of allegory and music which rejected the avante garde in favour of romanticism. Critic Harold C. Schonberg stated in his review in The New York Times that, However, Schonberg did praise the quality of both the acting and singing given by the performers. The cast included John Reardon as The Bridegroom, Judith Raskin as The Bride, Elaine Bonazzi as The Spy, Robert White as The Old Chess Player, Beverly Wolff as The Executive Director, Bob Rickner as The Executive Director's Secretary, Frank Porretta as The Astronaut, Leon Lishner as Death, John West as Death's Assistant, Nikiforos Naneris as The Bellboy, and Eugene Green as The Italian Opera Singer.

The song mistakenly references Aiken, SC, as the location of this savage beating. Batesburg, SC, a small textile milling town nearly 30 miles to the northeast served as the actual location of the incident which sparked a major civil rights issue. Guthrie later wrote, \"I sung this Isaac Woodard song in the Lewisohn Stadium one night for more than 36,000 people, and I got the loudest applause I've ever got in my whole life. This song is a long song, but most of the action is told in Isaac's own words.

It originated in the mid-1980s hardcore punk movement of Washington, D.C., where it was known as \"emotional hardcore\" or \"emocore\" and pioneered by bands such as Rites of Spring and Embrace. As the style was echoed by contemporary American punk rock bands, its sound and meaning shifted and changed, blending with pop punk and indie rock and encapsulated in the early 1990s by groups such as Jawbreaker and Sunny Day Real Estate. By the mid-1990s numerous emo acts emerged from the Midwestern and Central United States, and several independent record labels began to specialize in the style. Emo broke into mainstream culture in the early 2000s with the platinum-selling success of Jimmy Eat World and Dashboard Confessional and the emergence of the subgenre \"screamo\". In the wake of this success, many emo bands were signed to major record labels and the style became a marketable product. By the late 2000s, emo's popularity began to decrease. Some bands moved away from their emo roots and some bands also disbanded. An underground \"emo revival\" emerged in the 2010s, with bands drawing on the sounds and aesthetics of emo of the 1990s and early 2000s. Offshoot genres emerged such as emo pop and emoviolence (a style of screamo and powerviolence). The term \"emo\" has been applied by critics and journalists to a variety of artists, including multiplatinum acts and groups with disparate styles and sounds. In addition to music, \"emo\" is often used more generally to signify a particular relationship between fans and artists, and to describe related aspects of fashion, culture, and behavior. Emo has been associated with a stereotype that includes being particularly emotional, sensitive, shy, introverted, or angst-ridden. It has also been associated with stereotypes like depression, self-harm, and suicide.",

It was first played by the Ga ethnic group, most of whom live in and around the capital city, Accra, but is now performed and enjoyed throughout the country. It began in the early 1960s as an innovative dance form, influenced by American rock and roll, and giving the younger Ga generations a point of distinction from their elders. Ghanaian master drummer C.K. Ladzekpo states that kpanlogo \"is essentially an urban youth dance-drumming and a symbol of the commitment of a rapidly growing Ghanaian urban neighborhood youth in advocating their perspective in shaping the political vision of post colonial Africa\" (1995: web). The kpanlogo dance is often performed low to the ground, with bent knees and bent back, and frequently features sexually suggestive motions. The music accompanying the kpanlogo dance is drawn from older Ga drumming traditions, such as gome, oge and kolomashie. Kpanlogo music uses three types of instruments: nono (metal bell), fao (gourd rattle), and kpanlogo drums. Nono plays the key pattern or timeline of the music, supported by the fao. It is common to have three kpanlogo drums in an ensemble, in the roles of \"male voice\", \"female voice\" and \"master drum\". The main kpanlogo bell part is one of the most common and oldest key patterns found in sub-Saharan Africa. The bell pattern used in kpanlogo is the same as the son clave pattern heard Cuban music and salsa. It is also similar to the \"Bo Diddley beat\" popularized by the U.S. rhythm and blues musician Bo Diddley."

The libretto used is a Biblical story slightly modified by Zelenka. It is sung in Italian and it is untraditional in the fact that God has several passages in the cantata. The story is of the Jewish people travelling from Egypt to the Promised Land. Three Jews – Azaria, Egla and Namuel are fatigued by having to go on such a long journey and start complaining about their burden. This angers God, who sends one thousand snakes down to plague the blasphemers. Moses begs for forgiveness and is told by God to cast a snake out of bronze, hence the name Il Serpente di Bronzo – serpent of bronze. Anyone who is bitten by a snake and sees the bronze serpent will be saved. The end of the cantata is a repetition of the chorus from the beginning."

      "description": "Scriabin's Piano Sonata No. 2 in G-sharp minor, (Op. 19, also titled Sonata-Fantasy) took five years for him to write. It was finally published in 1898, at the urging of his publisher. The piece is in two movements, with a style combining Chopin-like Romanticism with an impressionistic touch. The piece is widely appreciated and is one of Scriabin's more popular pieces. The first movement Andante begins with echoing effects, followed by two lyrically themed sections. After a short climax, the piece modulates to E major (also C-sharp minor) and lyrical sections are restated with a slightly more complicated accompaniment. The second movement Presto, in sharp contrast to the first movement, is very fast and intense. In fact, at the given tempo indication, the second movement averages nearly 15 notes per second, making it comparable to an étude. Alternating crescendos and decrescendos may give the listener the impression of waves. The precedent of Beethoven's 'Moonlight' Sonata allowed Scriabin the luxury of an opening slow movement to his Second Sonata, whose programme reads thus[citation needed]: \"The first section represents the quiet of a southern night on the seashore; the development is the dark agitation of the deep, deep sea. The E major middle section shows caressing moonlight coming up after the first darkness of night. The second movement represents the vast expanse of ocean in stormy agitation.\" Like Scriabin's other sonatas, it is both technically and musically highly demanding for the pianist and is written for large hands (in fact, there is an enormous reach of a twelfth, although many pianists[who?] will agree that this implies an unnotated arpeggio). The piece lasts about 11 minutes."

The author is unknown and it is said that it is nothing more than a folk song. Some sources say that it arose during the late 19th century, from the floral games at the annual Carnival in the port of Guaymas, Mexico. The inspiration came from a woman named Maria Dolores Ferrá Calderón, the adopted daughter of a Barber. Both Maria and her father were natives and residents of the port. In 1967, the famous Mexican singer, Estanislao García Espinosa signed a deal with the record company RCA Victor. He presented the song to the Society of Authors and Composers of Mexico (SACM) with the title “The Beautiful Lola”, and an uncertain history. The SACM, through Maria Elena Parra, found a pre-existing copy of the song, also with the title The Beautiful Lola. The composer Don Juan Solano had registered the song in the Spanish registry in 1966. Maria Elena, given these two contradictory documents, doubted the songs authenticity and catalogued it as in the public domain.The version popular in Mexico and sung by merchant sailors is:MY BEAUTIFUL LOLAWHEN ON THE BEACH MY BEAUTIFUL LOLAHER PRETTY FIGURE GOES A'SHININGTHE SAILORS BECOME SO CRAZYEVEN THE CAPTAIN LOSES THE COMPASSOH THE PLEASURE I FELTWHEN AT THE BEACHSHE TOOK OUT HER HANDKERCHIEF AND WAVED TO ME LATER SHE APPROACHED MEGAVE ME A HUG AND WITHIN HER GRASP I THOUGHT I HAD DIEDAND WE THE POOR SAILORSHAVE MADE A LITTLE BOAT OF WAXTO LIVE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SEAFOR ONE CANNOT LIVE ON THE LAND."

The genre is similar to and sometimes overlaps with deathrock, although deathrock leans more towards an atmospheric Gothic rock sound while horror punk leans towards a 1950s-influenced doo-wop and rockabilly sound. Horrorpunk music is typically more aggressive and melodic than deathrock. The Misfits are recognized as the progenitors of horror punk, releasing a series of singles and EPs beginning in 1977 before releasing their first full-length album Walk Among Us in 1982. Horror punk is generally apolitical in comparison to other punk rock subgenres, although some songs do refer to political events (e.g. the Misfits' \"Bullet\", which discusses the assassination of John F. Kennedy), and some artists like Jack Grisham (on the left) and Michale Graves (on the right) have espoused their own political views. Horror hardcore, refers to a hybrid of horror punk and hardcore punk. The Misfits' 1983 album Earth A.D. inaugurated this style and the bands Septic Death, The Banner, and Integrity have also been categorized into this subgenre.",

      "description": "Aram Khachaturian wrote his Cello Concerto in E minor in 1946 for Sviatoslav Knushevitsky. It was the last of the three concertos he wrote for the individual members of a renowned Soviet piano trio that performed together from 1941 until 1963. The others were: the Piano Concerto for Lev Oborin (1936); and the Violin Concerto for David Oistrakh (1940). Although the last written of the three, the Cello Concerto was the first one Khachaturian had considered writing, when he was a cello student at the Gnessin Institute. The work was premiered on 30 October 1946 (or November 1946), in the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory, with the dedicatee Sviatoslav Knushevitsky as soloist. The conductor was Aleksandr Gauk. The Cello Concerto is the least known of the three concertos, and has not entered the core repertoire of cellists in the way the other two have for pianists and violinists. It has received relatively few recordings. The work is said to echo Khachaturian's painful experiences of war-time. It contains many allusions to folk material and dance rhythms such as the ashoug. It has been described as more of a symphony with cello than a cello concerto. The three movements are: The opening movement contains sections of a brooding quality, and even quotes the Dies Irae. It is rhapsodic and changeable in its moods. It contains a lengthy cadenza but has little by way of thematic development. The central Andante has been described as 'introspective and melancholy', 'nocturnal and seductive', 'dramatic and stern', and 'menacing, oriental and melismatic'. The third movement is full of bustle and tension. However, its energy level decreases until just near the end, when it concludes with a fast coda. The work was one of the reasons Khachaturian was ousted from the Composers Union, and he and other Soviet composers were denounced for formalism in the Zhdanov Decree of 1948."

While the murder itself was not shown on the stage, the audience were left with the body of Caesar conspicuously in view during the closing scenes. As with other Bianchi operas, there were innovations: the chorus participated actively in the drama, there was a ballet and a pantomime, a duet for two men, and a final oath scene (giuramento), besides the basically unconventional tragic ending."

Henze himself said it was written using Henze included quotations from the song of the Vietnamese Liberation Front, 'Stars in the Night', first heard played on the banjo and also from Mikis Theodorakis' 'Song of Freedom' on the guitar. Henze later improvises on the Cuban dance rhythm 'Son' which he contrasts with the more traditional sound of the European orchestra. However Henze himself has described the work overall as \"a Lutheran, Protestant symphony\" but with \"a Pagan body\" and whose \"pulse and blood are black\" It was first performed on 26 November 1969 by an orchestra assembled for the occasion at the University of Havana, with the composer conducting. In 1972 the London Symphony Orchestra recorded it, again under the baton of the composer. In 1994 Henze rewrote the improvised passages in full, and the revised symphony was premiered by the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra under Ingo Metzmacher.

It was first performed in Venice, Italy at the Teatro San Moisè on 9 May 1812. The overture has been frequently recorded and continues to be featured in the modern concert repertoire. From 1810 to 1813, the young Rossini composed four Italian farse, beginning with La cambiale di matrimonio (The Bill of Marriage), his first opera, and ending with Il Signor Bruschino. These types of short pieces were popular in Venice at the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century. The pieces were intimate, with a cast of five to seven singers, always including a pair of lovers, at least two comic parts, and one or two other minor roles. The style called for much visual comedy improvised by the players. As compared to many genres of opera, acting and comedic talent is more important relative to the required singing ability. Rossini’s farces also have a significant sentimental element."

      "description": "Black metal is an extreme subgenre and subculture of heavy metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, shrieking (sometimes growling or both) vocal style, heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere, though many other characteristics and techniques may be employed. Artists often appear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms. During the 1980s, several thrash and death metal bands formed a prototype for black metal. This so-called first wave included bands such as Venom, Bathory, Mercyful Fate, Hellhammer and Celtic Frost. A second wave arose in the early 1990s, spearheaded by Norwegian bands such as Mayhem, Darkthrone, Burzum, Gorgoroth, Immortal and Emperor. The early Norwegian black metal scene developed the style of their forebears into a distinct genre. Norwegian-inspired black metal scenes emerged throughout Europe and North America, although some other scenes developed their own styles independently. Some prominent Swedish bands spawned during this second wave. Bands such as Marduk, Nifelheim and Dark Funeral are notable examples. Initially a synonym for \"Satanic metal,\" black metal is often met with hostility from mainstream culture, due to the actions and ideologies associated with it. Many artists express extreme anti-Christian and misanthropic views, advocating various forms of Satanism or ethnic paganism. In the 1990s, members of the scene were responsible for a spate of church burnings and murders. There is also a small neo-Nazi movement within black metal, although it has been shunned by many prominent artists. Generally, black metal strives to be inaccessible to the mainstream and those who are not committed.",

Screamo lyrics often feature topics such as emotional pain, romantic interest, politics, and human rights. The term \"screamo\" is complicated in usage, and many bands object to the label. The term can include several different vocal styles or qualities that are associated with the term. Some bands with a guttural vocal style could be included although not universally. Also, it has been used to describe many different genres, including modern post-hardcore and metalcore. Several other genres are rooted in screamo, including: emoviolence, which combines screamo with powerviolence; crunkcore, a style of crunk employing the vocal technique of screamo; screamo influenced by grindcore; and Nintendocore rooted in screamo.",

When she is discovered, (the crew/her lover) determine to drown her. The captain saves her and they marry. Based on similarity of title, some connect this song with \"Canaday-I-O, Michigan-I-O, Colley's Run I-O\". There is no connection in plot, however, and any common lyrics are probably the result of cross-fertilization. The Scottish song \"Caledonia/Pretty Caledonia\" is quite different in detail — so much so that it is separate from the \"Canada-I-O\" texts in the Roud Folk Song Index (\"Canaday-I-O\" is #309; \"Caledonia\" is #5543).

Gloriana was the name given by the 16th-century poet Edmund Spenser to his character representing Queen Elizabeth I in his poem The Faerie Queene. It became the popular name given to Elizabeth I. It is recorded that the troops at Tilbury hailed her with cries of \"Gloriana, Gloriana, Gloriana\", after the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588. The opera depicts the relationship between Queen Elizabeth and the Earl of Essex, and was composed for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in June 1953. Several in the audience of its gala opening were disappointed by the opera, which presents the first Elizabeth as a sympathetic, but flawed, character motivated largely by vanity and desire. The premiere was one of Britten's few critical failures, and the opera was not included in the series of complete Decca recordings conducted by the composer. However, a symphonic suite extracted from the opera by the composer (Opus 53a), which includes the Courtly Dances, is often performed as a concert piece."

      "description": "Piae Cantiones ecclesiasticae et scholasticae veterum episcoporum (in English Pious ecclesiastical and school songs of the ancient bishops) is a collection of late medieval Latin songs first published in 1582. It was compiled by Jacobus Finno (Latin form) or Jaakko Suomalainen (Finnish form), a clergyman who was headmaster of the cathedral school at Turku. Publication was undertaken by Theodoricus Petri Rutha of Nyland (Swedish form) or Uusimaa (Finnish form), who lived from about 1560 to about 1630. He came from an aristocratic family in Finland, and was educated at Rostock. The collection Piae Cantiones was published in Greifswald (Part of Swedish territory 1648-1815, though now in Germany) and includes 74 Latin and Swedish/Latin songs that were sung at the time in Finnish cathedral schools, most notably in the cathedral school at Turku. Most of them are religious in nature but some, for example Tempus adest floridum, are secular school songs. The lyrics in the collection testify to the moderate nature of the Protestant Reformation in Sweden. Although some Catholic nuances have been purged, many songs still carry strong traces of the cult of Virgin Mary (e.g. Ave Maris Stella). Although published as late as 1582, the melodies of Piae Cantiones are medieval by nature. The origin of the songs and melodies varies. Many originate from Central Europe but quite a few seem to have been written in Nordic countries. In 1625 the collection was re-published with 13 further songs. Later versions of this collection were compiled by Finns Henricus Fattbuur and Mathias Tolia. A Finnish translation of Piae Cantiones (1616) was done by Hemming of Masku, who earlier (1605) had published a remarkable Finnish hymnal. The songs of Piae Cantiones were popular in Finnish schools until the 19th century but fell gradually in disuse. However, a newly awakened interest in this old music has made them quite popular and they belong to the standard repertoire of any Finnish or Swedish choir. Many of Hemming's translations are present (with some modernization) in the official book of anthems of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland. In this way, Piae Cantiones still enriches Finnish spiritual life."

Palm-wine music left an influence on many styles, especially soukous and highlife. Though still somewhat popular, the genre is no longer as renowned as it once was.

It may have been inspired by the war of the Jacobite rising of 1715 (John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll was the loyalist war leader and many Scottish loyalists were Campbells); According to Lewis Winstock the tune accompanied the Scottish loyalist vanguard in the Jacobite war, and Robert Wodrow ascribes that name to one of the bagpipe tunes that accompanied Argyle's Highlanders entrance into Perth and Dundee. Or it may have been concerned with earlier events around the deposing of Mary Queen of Scots: \"Lochleven\" presumably refers to Lochleven Castle where Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned in 1567, and \"Great Argyl\" may refer to Archibald Campbell, 5th Earl of Argyll who attempted to rescue her. The song is commonly attributed to Robert Burns, like many Scottish songs which are actually traditional or of unknown origin. Burns did write a version with some different verses, which he published in the Scots Musical Museum, a collection of Scottish folk songs (and some new songs) published between 1787 and 1803."

The title may be interpreted as \"Chit-chat\" and may refer to the Viennese passion for gossip. Strauss may also have been referencing the single act burlesque \"Der Tritsch-tratsch\" (with music by Adolf Müller, Sr.) by the famous Austrian dramatist and actor Johann Nestroy, which premiered in 1833 and was still in the stage repertoire when the polka was written. Many point out that the title may also have meant his first wife's (Henrietta Treffz) poodle, also named Tritsch-tratsch, but this etymology remains unsubstantiated as well. The mood of the piece is jaunty and high-spirited, as were many of Strauss' polkas."

Generally, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound, in contrast to the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in styles such as doom metal and death metal. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \"powerful\" sound. The term was first used in the middle of the '80s and refers to two different but related styles: the first pioneered and largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a later more widespread and popular style based in Europe (especially Scandinavia, Germany, Greece and Italy), South America (especially Brazil and Argentina) and Japan, with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards.",

The first two movements are tripartite in form while the third has been compared by Richard Dyer to a toccata. Sessions worked on the sonata in conjunction with his second symphony, completed the same year, and his opera Montezuma, but the latter did not achieve final form until much later. The sonata is one of Sessions' relatively often-recorded works.

      "description": "Brisbane punk rock had its main impact between 1975 and 1984 as part of the overall punk rock scene in Australia. According to rock music historian, Ian McFarlane, the Queensland capital provided \"some of the most anarchistic bands\" of that era whilst it was \"arguably the most conservative city\" in the country. The development of the local punk movement differed from other cities because of its relative geographic isolation from other similar trends. The Brisbane scene also received a greater scrutiny by local police where early punk bands formed as \"an obvious backlash to an oppressed society\". This generated antagonistic and individualistic groups or \"snot\" driven punk bands. The Brisbane punk rock movement can be divided into four phases. First, there was the pioneering chapter, which lasted from 1975 to 1977. These bands were either innovators or part of the first wave of local punk bands. Foremost of all such groups are the Saints, which are acknowledged as \"Aussie punk pioneers\". The second phase occurred between 1978 and 1980, which McFarlane described as \"the second generation\" of punk groups. The next period or \"third-generation\" spanned from 1981 to 1984 and diverged into two subgenres: hardcore punk and post-punk (or dark punk). Brisbane's dark punk is similar to the subgenres of horror punk and deathrock from the West Coast United States, which started at that time. The fourth period, during 1985 to 1988, developed three styles: Detroit rock (and the closely aligned garage punk), hardcore punk and skate punk – the Brisbane punk rock movement had become alternative rock."

The work was premiered at Orford Church, Suffolk, England, on 9 June 1966 by the English Opera Group. Set designs were by Annena Stubbs. Colin Graham was the stage director of this first production. The scale and manner of instrumentation are similar to those in Curlew River, but one notable difference is the use of the alto trombone.

Despite the title, it is considered to be more in the style of a cantata than a symphony. Principally composed between 1935 and 1947, but not completed until 1957, it is an eleven-movement setting of poems by Bertolt Brecht, drawn mainly from Brecht's Songs, Poems and Choruses of 1934, and by Ignazio Silone, adapted by Eisler. It was premiered in its full form at the German State Opera, East Berlin, on 24 April 1959. Brecht had died in 1956. Eisler's theme was the advance of Nazism in Germany. Yet the composer encountered difficulties in both reception and performance of the work throughout its long period of composition and development. When the first two movements (at this stage subtitled An Anti-Hitler Symphony) won a prize at the 15th Festival of the International Society for Contemporary Music, gaining a promised performance of them at the 1937 Paris World Exhibition, the Nazi regime persuaded the French government to have the performance cancelled. And it was not until 1995 that the work was finally given a studio recording, with soloists and the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra under Lothar Zagrosek; this was released in Decca Records' Entartete Musik series."

      "description": "Symphony No. 1 (Op. 7) by Soviet-Russian composer Gavriil Nikolayevich Popov is a composition that was banned from performance in the U.S.S.R. until recently. Popov had completed a sketch of the first movement by August 1929 and was preparing its last (third) movement by February 1930. The work, still in draft form, won a prize sponsored by the Bolshoi Theatre and the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda in September 1932. It received its premiere by the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra under conductor Fritz Stiedry on March 22, 1935. One day after its premiere, Popov's symphony was banned by the Leningrad censorship board for reflecting 'the ideology of classes hostile to us.' Soviet authorities lifted the ban until Popov was denounced as a 'formalist' composer through his association with Dmitri Shostakovich in 1936. Popov's symphony was denied further performance in the U.S.S.R. and, consequently, worldwide until after his death in 1972. Popov's Symphony No. 1 is in three movements and roughly 50 minutes long, utilizing a large symphonic orchestra. The movements are: While obscure, Popov's Symphony No. 1 holds a unique place in Soviet musical history and influenced composers such as Dmitri Shostakovich and Alfred Schnittke. The symphony was written during a period of greater Soviet artistic freedom, inspired by avant-gardists such as Igor Stravinsky, Paul Hindemith, Béla Bartók, and composers from the Second Viennese School. Also of influence were the late-romantic symphonies of Gustav Mahler. Popov's symphony is a highly dynamic work that uses expressionism and freeform styles of composition that were popular in Europe at the time. The symphony is known as a major inspiration for Shostakovich's Symphony No. 4, a similarly themed work in three movements. Ironically, Shostakovich withdrew his symphony from its Leningrad premiere during this stretch of artistic repression and, like Popov's, was not heard in the concert hall until decades later. After the 1936 debacle, Popov's composition style changed, fearing later condemnation by the Soviet government. While suffering from emotional conflicts and worsening alcoholism, he wrote five other symphonies that are widely viewed as conformist and devoid of his earlier originality. Symphony No. 1 has experienced a modest revival by orchestras and recording labels such as Telarc, but remains more of a curiosity than a normal part of the repertoire."

The story is based on the 1731 novel L’histoire du chevalier des Grieux et de Manon Lescaut by the Abbé Prévost and should not be confused with Manon, an 1884 opera by Jules Massenet based on the same novel. The libretto is in Italian, and was cobbled together by five librettists whom Puccini employed: Ruggero Leoncavallo, Marco Praga, Giuseppe Giacosa, Domenico Oliva and Luigi Illica. The publisher, Giulio Ricordi, and the composer himself also contributed to the libretto. So confused was the authorship of the libretto that no one was credited on the title page of the original score. However, it was Illica and Giacosa who completed the libretto and went on to contribute the libretti to Puccini's next three – and most successful – works, La Bohème, Tosca and Madama Butterfly. Puccini took some musical elements in Manon Lescaut from earlier works he had written. For example, the madrigal Sulla vetta tu del monte from Act II echoes the Agnus Dei from his 1880 Messa a quattro voci. Other elements of Manon Lescaut come from his compositions for strings: the quartet Crisantemi (January 1890), three Menuets (probably 1884) and a Scherzo (1883?). The love theme comes from the aria Mentia l'avviso (1883)."

Stylistically, C-ambient differs from ambient in that C-ambient employs elements of ethnic Chinese music and traditional Chinese music instruments which can be played with a pentatonic scale, such as er hu and pi pa, often electric, electroacoustic or distorted as opposed to acoustic.",

      "description": "Punk rock (or simply punk) is a rock music genre that developed between 1974 and 1976 in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in garage rock and other forms of what is now known as protopunk music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produced recordings and distributed them through informal channels. The term \"punk\" was first used in relation to rock music by some American critics in the early 1970s, to describe garage bands and their devotees. By late 1976, bands such as the Sex Pistols, the Clash and the Damned in London, and Television, Patti Smith, and the Ramones in New York City were recognized as the vanguard of a new musical movement. The following year saw punk rock spreading around the world, and it became a major cultural phenomenon in the United Kingdom. For the most part, punk took root in local scenes that tended to reject association with the mainstream. Though originally more diverse and accepting, it evolved to create an \"angry white male\" punk stereotype with a \"color blind\" attitude. An associated punk subculture emerged, expressing youthful rebellion and characterized by distinctive styles of clothing and adornment (ranging from deliberately offensive T-shirts, leather jackets, spike bands and other studded or spiked jewelry to bondage and S&M clothes) and a variety of anti-authoritarian ideologies. By the beginning of the 1980s, faster, more aggressive styles such as hardcore (e.g. Black Flag) and Oi! (e.g. Cock Sparrer) had become the predominant mode of punk rock. Musicians identifying with or inspired by punk also pursued a broad range of other variations, giving rise to post-punk and the alternative rock movement. At the end of the 20th century, punk rock had been adopted by the mainstream, as pop punk and punk rock bands such as Green Day, Sublime, the Offspring and Blink-182 brought the genre widespread popularity.",

The plot was based on the story of the Greek Goddess Leucothea. Leucothoé was originally intended to be a pastoral opera but Bickerstaff was unable to secure a composer to set it to music. In May 1756 it was published by Robert Dodsley at the price of 1 shilling and sixpence. In a contemporary review in the Monthly Review, critic Ralph Griffiths generally praised the work, although he criticised the tragic ending, as \"the laws of the Opera require a happy ending\". While well received by the limited critics who reviewed it, the work was largely ignored both by critics and the public. This failure led Bickerstaff to rejoin the military, although he went on to have a string of successes between 1760 and 1772 often in collaboration with the composer Thomas Arne."

The opera was composed between March 1867 and July 1868, and it received its first performance on 11 February 1869 at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow. It was a benefit for Alexandra Menshikova. In the 1870s Tchaikovsky destroyed the manuscript full score of the opera, while recycling much of the first act in his The Oprichnik (1870–1872). The subject of The Voyevoda was thus left available to his former pupil Anton Arensky to compose as the opera Dream on the Volga in 1888. During the Soviet period The Voyevoda was posthumously reconstructed from surviving orchestral and vocal parts and the composer's sketches."

The play tells the story of a man in love with a girl. She claims she has won a lottery, however, making another man pursue her for the fortune and forcing her original suitor to pay off the other for her hand in marriage, though she does not win. The Lottery mocks the excitement of the lottery and those who sell, rent, or purchase tickets. It was highly successful and set the tone for Fielding's later ballad operas. The play was altered on 1 February 1732 and this revised edition was seen as a great improvement."

It was developed in the early and mid-1940s. This style of jazz ultimately became synonymous with modern jazz, when both categories reached a certain final maturity in the 1960s. Bebop developed as the younger generation of jazz musicians aimed to counter the popular swing style with a new, non-danceable music that demanded listening. As bebop was no longer a dance music, it enabled the musicians to play at faster tempos. Bebop musicians explored advanced harmonies, complex syncopation, altered chords, chord substitutions, asymmetrical phrasing, and intricate melodies and used rhythm sections in a way that expanded their role. The classic bebop combo consisted of saxophone, trumpet, piano, double bass and drums. Some of the most influential bebop artists are: tenor sax players Dexter Gordon, Sonny Rollins and John Coltrane; alto sax player Charlie Parker; trumpeters Fats Navarro, Clifford Brown, and Dizzy Gillespie; pianists Bud Powell and Thelonious Monk; guitarist Charlie Christian, and drummer Max Roach.",

Sir John Barbirolli conducted the premiere of the piece on 2 May 1956, with the Hallé Orchestra. Eugene Ormandy gave the work its U.S. Premiere with the Philadelphia Orchestra on 5 October 1956. The following year, on 30 June 1957, Leopold Stokowski conducted it with the London Symphony Orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall, the composer being present in the Royal Box.The Eighth Symphony is the shortest of Vaughan Williams' nine symphonies, with a typical performance clocking at just under a half hour, yet is remarkably inventive, especially in the composer's experiments in sonority. Not only does he use a much-expanded percussion section, including \"all the 'phones and 'spiels known to the composer\" (as well as three tuned gongs, the same as were used in Puccini's Turandot), but the two central movements use only the wind section and string section respectively. Among his symphonies the Fourth symphony is the only other one to end loudly. (The others all have quiet conclusions, often with the Vaughan Williams \"fingerprint\" niente.) The symphony is scored for a large orchestra including: The work is in four movements: 1. Fantasia (Variazioni senza tema) (variations without a theme) (in D minor) - the composer also referred to this as being \"seven variations in search of a theme.\" Even though the variation structure predominates the acute listener may notice elements of sonata form.rondo form, has a meditative character and includes important solo passages for violin and cello. The main theme bears a clear resemblance, which Vaughan Williams acknowledged[citation needed], to the \"Passion\" chorale (O Sacred Head, Now Wounded) that Bach used several times in the St. Matthew Passion and elsewhere. This movement closes quietly in E major. 4. Toccata (in D major / D minor) - the finale (entitled Toccata to indicate its virtuoso nature) contains much exuberant writing for the percussion section. Harmonically, the movement seems uncertain of whether to be in D minor or D major. The movement ends loudly with a D, in a D Aeolian (natural minor) context."

The oldest of the texts have been dated to between ca. 2400–2300 BC. Unlike the later Coffin Texts and Book of the Dead, the pyramid texts were reserved only for the pharaoh and were not illustrated. Following the earlier Palermo Stone, the pyramid texts mark the next-oldest known mention of Osiris, who would become the most important deity associated with afterlife in the Ancient Egyptian religion. The spells, or \"utterances\", of the pyramid texts are primarily concerned with protecting the pharaoh's remains, reanimating his body after death, and helping him ascend to the heavens, which are the emphasis of the afterlife during the Old Kingdom. The spells delineate all of the ways the pharaoh could travel, including the use of ramps, stairs, ladders, and most importantly flying. The spells could also be used to call the gods to help, even threatening them if they did not comply."

      "description": "Koothu (Tamil: கூத்து), and alternatively spelt as kuttu, means dance or performance in Tamil, it is a folk art originated from the early Tamil country. But more precisely Koothu refers to either Terukuttu (Tamil:தெருக்கூத்து) or Kattaikkuttu. The terms Terukkuttu and Kattaikkuttu are often used interchangeably in modern times; however, historically the two terms appear to have distinguished, at least in certain villages, between two different kinds of performance: while Terukkuttu referred to mobile performances in a procession, Kattaikkuttu denotes overnight, narrative performances at a fixed performance space. Koothu as a form of entertainment reached its peak hundreds of years ago in Tamil Nadu, as mentioned in the Sangam texts about the development of iyal (literature), isai (music) and natagam (drama). Going beyond just a means of entertainment, koothu educates the rural people about religion and their history. Koothu is an informal dance structure, the performances generally depict scenes from ancient epics like Ramayana, Mahabharatha and Tamil other classical epics. There are traditionally no dialogues, instead only songs. Artists are trained to sing in their own voice and in a high pitch to reach the entire crowd, since no amplification technology is used. The artists are dressed up with complex heavy costumes and have a very bright elaborated makeup. They put on towering head dresses, sparkling shoulder plates and wide colorful skirts. Traditionally this theater form has been predominately male, though in modern times more females have been included (e.g., Girl's theater at the Kattaikkuttu Gurukulam). Types of koothu includes Nattu Koothu, Kuravai Koothu, and Valli Koorhu, which are about the state and culture of different peoples in Tamil country; Samaya Koothu showcase religious topics, while Porkaala Koothu, Pei Koothu, Thunangai Koothu are focused on the martial arts and war of the country. Another important art form viz, Chakyar koothu is very popular in Kerala. There is mention of this koothu in Silapathikaram. In years past there were no formal training institutions, schools or nattuvanar (teacher) for koothu. Now to encourage the dying art there are some workshops for koothu called koothu pattarai, and also some dedicated schools (e.g., Kattaikkuttu Gurukulam). It is very popular among the rural areas and has remained relatively unchanged even in modern times. Koothu eventually spread out from Tamil Nadu intomost of south India, particularly Karnatakka and Kerala. The deity at the Thillai Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram is known from the Sangam period as \"Thillai Koothan\", the cosmic dancer of Thillai; the Sanskrit translation of this is Nataraja.",

Many major composers have contributed to the violin concerto repertoire, with the best known works including those by Bach, Bartók, Beethoven, Brahms, Bruch, Mendelssohn, Mozart, Paganini, Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Sibelius, Tchaikovsky, and Vivaldi.Traditionally a three-movement work, the violin concerto has been structured in four movements by a number of modern composers, including Dmitri Shostakovich, Igor Stravinsky, and Alban Berg (in the latter, the first two and last two movements are connected, with the only break coming between the second and third). In some violin concertos, especially from the Baroque and modern eras, the violin (or group of violins) is accompanied by a chamber ensemble rather than an orchestra—for instance, Vivaldi's L'estro armonico, originally scored for four violins, two violas, cello, and continuo, and Allan Pettersson's first concerto, for violin and string quartet."

However, a common theme as with most Christian music is praise, worship or thanks to God and Christ. Traditional gospel music was popular in the mid-20th century.

Specifically, the merong is the initial part of a gendhing. A merong cannot be played on its own, but must be followed by a minggah, which may also take the form of a ladrang or other colotomic structure. The merong is the longest of the sections used in gamelan composition. It consists of a single gongan lasting four nongan, but the nongan can be of different lengths. Merong are then classified according to the number of kethuk strokes in a nongan in each section. The merong does not use the kempyang or kempul. There are two patterns for the kethuk in the merong, arang (\"infrequent, sparse\") and kerep (\"frequent\"). Both have the kethuk play only at the end of a gatra, but in the kerep pattern, it is at the end of all odd-numbered gatras, whereas in the arang, it is at the end of the gatras of doubled odd numbers (that is, gatras 2, 6, 10, 14, etc.). For example, consider a \"gendhing kethuk 2 kerep minggah kethuk 4.\" This means that in the merong, there will be two kethuk strokes that happen on odd-numbered gatra. The structure would then look like: where \".\" indicates no interpunctuating instrument plays, p indicates the stroke of the kempyang, T the ketuk, N the kenong, and G the simultaneous stroke of the gong and kenong. Thus, in each section, the gong plays once, the kenong divides that into four parts, and then that is divided into parts according to the given structure. Here, in each part, each nongan lasts 16 beats (keteg), and thus the gongan lasts 64. That was a fairly short example; a \"kethuk 4 arang\" merong, for example, would look like: and thus a nongan would last 16 gatras (64 beats), and a gongan 64 gatras (256 beats). Obviously, in a long structure like that, especially at a slow tempo, a single gongan may last many minutes. The merong section may include a ngelik, which would also have the length of a single gongan."

Its first performance was at the Ringtheater in Vienna on 28 November 1878 with Ziehrer himself directing the theatre orchestra. The operetta was only of mediocre popularity and its fate was sealed when the Ringtheatre inferno happened in 1881 which destroyed large parts of the orchestral score. Of the entire score, the only pieces which survived were the Overture, the piano excerpts as well as the aria \"Verliebt\" (In Love). König Lustig (or \"Lustik\"/\"Lustick\"/\"Lustigk\") was the popular nickname for Jérôme Bonaparte (1784–1860) when he was King of Westphalia from 1807 to 1813."

Youth crew is distinguished from other hardcore and punk scenes by its optimism and moralist outlook. The original youth crew bands and fans were predominantly straight edge and vegetarian advocates. Early musical influences included Minor Threat, Bad Brains, Negative Approach, Cro-Mags, and Agnostic Front. While some youth crew music is similar to melodic hardcore, other styles can be very thrash metal influenced and also includes breakdowns intended for the hardcore dancing style associated with live performances. Youth of Today was a very thrashy youth crew band, with abrasive vocals and fast songs too short to include a lot of melody (similar to early Agnostic Front, and contrasting with the other big New York City youth crew bands such as Gorilla Biscuits). Later youth crew bands took increasing influence from heavy metal.",

The publication includes all the sonatas as published by Walsh in 1732; and those sonatas, as well as extras included by Chrysander, include the body of work that is known as Handel's \"Opus 1\". In addition to the 15 sonatas indicated by the title of the publication, Chrysander appended the score for an additional four sonatas. The first sixteen sonatas (Ia, Ib, and numbers II to XV) were included as part of the HG volume 27. Sonata VI and the final four sonatas were included as part of HG volume 48 (pp. 112–139). The musical instrument mentioned at the start of each sonata does not always match the instrument for which the work was originally written by Handel, however Chrysander was aware that the sale of the publication would be enhanced by the inclusion of a wide variety of instruments. Each sonata displays the melody and bass lines—with the expectation that a competent keyboard player would supply the omitted inner parts based on the figured bass markings. Despite the title, there are five instruments mentioned in the work: the traversa (flute), the flauto (recorder), the hoboy (oboe), the violin, and the viola da gamba."

It is sometimes referred to as simply Cheryomushki. Cheryomushki is a district in Moscow full of cheap subsidized housing built in 1956, and the word is also commonly used for such housing projects in general. The libretto was written by the experienced team of Vladimir Mass and Mikhail Chervinsky, leading Soviet humorists of the day. The satirical plot dealt with a topical theme geared to one of the most pressing concerns of urban Russians, the chronic housing shortages and the difficulties of securing livable conditions. Cheryomushki translates to “bird-cherry trees” and the operetta was named after a real housing estate in southwest Moscow. The work was completed in 1958 and received its premiere in the capital on 24 January 1959. The operetta is reminiscent of Shostakovich’s popular music of the period, yet at the same time it engages a satirical assessment of the housing redevelopments in Moscow."

      "description": "The Symphony No. 6 in E flat minor, Op. 23 by Nikolai Myaskovsky was composed between 1921 and 1923. It is the largest and most ambitious of his 27 symphonies, planned on a Mahlerian scale, and uses a chorus in the finale. It has been described as 'probably the most significant Russian symphony between Tchaikovsky's Pathétique and the Fourth Symphony of Shostakovich'. (Myaskovsky in fact wrote part of the work in Klin, where Tchaikovsky wrote the Pathétique.) The premiere took place at the Bolshoi Theatre, Moscow on 4 May 1924, conducted by Nikolai Golovanov and was a notable success. Soviet commentators used to describe the work as an attempt to portray the development and early struggles of the Soviet state, but it is now known that its roots were more personal. The harsh, emphatically descending chordal theme with which the symphony begins apparently arose in the composer's mind at a mass rally in which he heard the Soviet Procurator Nikolai Krylenko conclude his speech with the call \"Death, death to the enemies of the revolution!\" Myaskovsky had been affected by the deaths of his father, his close friend Alexander Revidzev and his aunt Yelikonida Konstantinovna Myaskovskaya, and especially by seeing his aunt’s body in a bleak, empty Petrograd flat during the winter of 1920. In 1919 the painter Lopatinsky, who had been living in Paris, sang Myaskovsky some French Revolutionary songs which were still current among Parisian workers: these would find their way into the symphony's finale. He was also influenced by Les Aubes (The Dawns), a verse drama by the Belgian writer Emile Verhaeren, which enacted the death of a revolutionary hero and his funeral."

However, street punk continued beyond the confines of the original Oi! form with bands such as GBH, Chaos UK, Discharge, The Anti-Nowhere League and Oxymoron. Street punks generally have a much more ostentatious and flamboyant appearance than the working class or skinhead image cultivated by many Oi! groups. Street punks commonly sported multi-coloured hair, mohawks, tattoos, heavily studded vests and leather jackets, and clothing, especially plaids, adorned with political slogans, patches, and/or the names of punk bands.",

It forms an important part of the violin repertoire and is one of the most popular and most frequently performed violin concertos of all time. A typical performance lasts just under half an hour.Mendelssohn originally proposed the idea of the violin concerto to Ferdinand David, a close friend and then concertmaster of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra. Although conceived in 1838, the work took another six years to complete and was not premiered until 1845. During this time, Mendelssohn maintained a regular correspondence with David, who gave him many suggestions. The work itself was one of the foremost violin concertos of the Romantic era and was influential on many other composers. Although the concerto consists of three movements in a standard fast–slow–fast structure and each movement follows a traditional form, the concerto was innovative and included many novel features for its time. Distinctive aspects include the almost immediate entrance of the violin at the beginning of the work (rather than following an orchestral preview of the first movement's major themes, as was typical in Classical-era concertos) and the through-composed form of the concerto as a whole, in which the three movements are melodically and harmonically connected and played attacca (each movement immediately following the previous one). The concerto was well received and soon became regarded as one of the greatest violin concertos of all time. The concerto remains popular to this day and has developed a reputation as an essential concerto for all aspiring concert violinists to master, and usually one of the first Romantic era concertos they learn. Many professional violinists have recorded the concerto and the work is regularly performed in concerts and classical music competitions. Mendelssohn also wrote a virtuoso Concerto for Violin and String Orchestra in D minor between 1821 and 1823, when he was 12 to 14 years old, at the same time that he produced his twelve string symphonies. This work was \"rediscovered\" and first recorded in 1951 by Yehudi Menuhin."

Bubblegum dance is similar to bubblegum pop music in that they both tend to have fun, childish subjects. The name \"bubblegum dance\" was coined probably because of its similarities with the 1950s pop music, in which the female artists often appeared in photos with a pink bubblegum balloon in their mouth and exaggerated, wide and colorful skirts. Some subsequent pop styles have also been silly and cheerful, such as 1980s pop music. In bubblegum dance tracks, females usually sing the chorus, often in a high-pitched tone. Males often provide rap vocals, which are sung in low tones. Bubblegum dance music can be described as cheerful, amusing, silly and childish, which may suggest that the songs are aimed at children. However, this is not always the case - it is common for \"bubblegum dance\" artists to use sexual or suggestive lyrics in their songs that are more appropriate for adult audiences. Many bubblegum dance acts have been heavily featured on the Dancemania series albums.",

Les vêpres followed immediately after Verdi's three great mid-career masterpieces, Rigoletto, Il trovatore and La traviata of 1850 to 1853 and was first performed at the Paris Opéra on 13 June 1855. Today it is better-known in its post-1861 Italian version as I vespri siciliani and it is occasionally performed. The story is based on a historical event, the Sicilian Vespers of 1282, using material drawn from the medieval Sicilian tract Lu rebellamentu di Sichilia."

Rhyming was most popular during the sponge fishing of the 1930s (the sponges having been killed by a fungus), and Peter Elliot is considered the best rhymer. Generally songs are structured verse-chorus-verse form, where the chorus is the goal of the verse, but in a rhyming spiritual the chorus becomes the accompaniment to the verse. The verse progresses over the chorus and eventually coincides, often with the rhymer dropping out for the last few words of the chorus. Usually there are three voices which make up the songs,the rhymer doing the melody, the Basser which does a very low tone accompaniment, and the falsetto performing high pitches."

Hamilton adapted his libretto from John Dryden's ode Alexander's Feast, or the Power of Music (1697) which had been written to celebrate Saint Cecilia's Day. Jeremiah Clarke (whose score is now lost) set the original ode to music. Handel composed the music in January 1736, and the work received its premiere at the Covent Garden Theatre, London, on 19 February 1736. In its original form it contained three concertos: a concerto in B flat major in 3 movements for \"Harp, Lute, Lyrichord and other Instruments\" HWV 294 for performance after the recitative Timotheus, plac'd on high in Part I; a concerto grosso in C major in 4 movements for oboes, bassoon and strings, now known as the \"Concerto in Alexander's Feast\" HWV 318, performed between Parts I and II; and an organ concerto HWV 289 in G minor and major in 4 movements for chamber organ, oboes, bassoon and strings performed after the chorus Let old Timotheus yield the prize in Part II. The organ concerto and harp concerto were published in 1738 by John Walsh as the first and last of the Handel organ concertos Op.4. Handel revised the music for performances in 1739, 1742 and 1751. Donald Burrows has discussed Handel's revisions to the score. The work describes a banquet held by Alexander the Great and his mistress Thaïs in the captured Persian city of Persepolis, during which the musician Timotheus sings and plays his lyre, arousing various moods in Alexander until he is finally incited to burn the city down in revenge for his dead Greek soldiers. The piece was a great success and it encouraged Handel to make the transition from writing Italian operas to English choral works. The soloists at the premiere were the sopranos Anna Maria Strada and Cecilia Young, the tenor John Beard, and a bass called Erard (first name unknown)."

The resonance parameters of the synth's LFOs are often high. These effects give the synth and bass unique \"wonky\" sounds, hence the name of the genre.",

The play was written by the Italian sixteenth-century playwright and librettist Girolamo Bargagli of Sienna in 1579 but was performed for the first time on 2 May 1589, after the author's death in 1586. It is perhaps best known for the fact that it was staged on the occasion of the marriage of Ferdinand I de' Medici, grand-duke of Tuscany, with Christine de Lorraine, granddaughter of the former queen-mother of France, Catherine de' Medici, in that year. Bernardo Buontalenti, known as the master of Florentine spectacle, created six intermezzo designs for the play. The play's musical interludes, or 'intermedii' have been performed more recently by the Huelgas Ensemble in 1998, by the Hollands Vocaal Ensemble in 2003, by the Capriccio Stravagante Renaissance Orchestra in 2007, and by Consort Astræa (selections) in 2009. A staged version was produced in 1989 in Minneapolis, Minnesota by the Ex Machina Baroque Opera Ensemble. In 2014, The Texas Early Music Project, based in Austin Texas, gave the first US performance in the 21st century. A total of six then-famous composers from Florence contributed to the music, which includes some of the most virtuosic vocal writing of the period in an early example of monody, in the opening aria 'Dalle piu alte sfere', which is believed to have been composed by Emilio de' Cavalieri (Palisca, Norton Anthology of Music), but is attributed elsewhere to Antonio Archilei, whose wife Vittoria sang this opening aria in the role of Armonia in the 1589 production."

      "description": "Michael Haydn's Symphony No. 23 in D major, Perger 43, Sherman 22, Sherman-adjusted 23, MH 287, is believed to have been written in Salzburg around 1779. It was attributed to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in Ludwig von Köchel's original catalog as K. 291. Scored for 2 oboes, 2 bassoons, 2 horns and strings. In three movements: The slow movement begins in D minor, sans winds at first. The oboes and horns come in with the change to D major. The third movement was at first mistaken by Köchel for a work of Mozart's. Mozart did in fact copy out the first 45 measures of it (Simon Sechter completed the score of the finale). Some time afterwards, he wrote his String Quartet in G major, K. 387, with a finale that is also a fugato and also begins with a theme consisting of four whole notes first stated by the second violin. Having the first 45 measures in Mozart's hand, it was natural for Köchel to assume that Mozart was the author. This symphony is one of the few by Michael Haydn to have a slow movement in a minor key (the others are No.s 6, 9 and 20) though in this one the D minor key signature changes to D major around the middle for the rest of the movement. Horns in D are used throughout, and in the fugal finale they even get to play the fugue subject a couple of times."

      "description": "Rinaldo (HWV 7) is an opera by George Frideric Handel composed in 1711. It is the first Italian language opera written specifically for the London stage. The libretto was prepared by Giacomo Rossi from a scenario provided by Aaron Hill. The work was first performed at the Queen's Theatre in London's Haymarket on 24 February 1711. The story of love, battle and redemption set at the time of the First Crusade is loosely based on Torquato Tasso's epic poem Gerusalemme liberata (Jerusalem Delivered), and its staging involved many original and vivid effects. It was a great success with the public, despite negative reactions from literary critics hostile to the trend towards Italian entertainment in English theatres. Handel composed the music for Rinaldo quickly. Much of it is borrowings and adaptations from operas and other works that Handel had composed during his long stay in Italy during 1706–10. In the years following the premiere, Handel frequently introduced new numbers, discarded others, and transposed parts to different voice ranges. Despite the lack of a standard edition, Rinaldo's spectacular vocal and orchestral passages make it one of Handel's greatest operas. Of its individual numbers, the soprano aria \"Lascia ch'io pianga\" has become a particular favourite and is a popular concert piece. Handel went on to dominate opera in England for several decades. Rinaldo was revived in London regularly up to 1717, and a revised version was presented in 1731. The opera was also performed in several European cities. During Handel's lifetime, Rinaldo was the most frequently performed of all the composer's musical dramas. After 1731, however, the opera was not staged for more than 200 years. Renewed interest in baroque opera during the 20th century led to the first modern professional production in Handel's birthplace, Halle, Germany, in 1954. The opera was mounted sporadically over the following thirty years. After a successful run at New York's Metropolitan Opera in 1984, performances and recordings of the work have become more frequent worldwide. The opera's tercentenary in 2011 brought a modernized production at the Glyndebourne Festival."

It is diametrically opposed to Bhangra music in that it is not a live music but instead relies on pre recorded musical parts with only the vocals being sung live along to a live repetitive dhol drum. The pre recorded music consists of primarily looped rhythm parts from both eastern and western percussion instruments and little to no melody on instruments. It borrows heavily from hip hop, however it is more traditional than its predecessor, Bhangra which rebelled against tradition and authenticity. Traditional folk instruments like dhol and tumbi are central to folkhop productions. Folkhop songs tend to be heavily produced by DJs on computer software. In the beginning, all songs start out as vocal only recordings that the folk singer records in India. This 'vocal only' recording is then sold on websites involved in the buying and selling of folkhop music. The DJs then pay a small sum for the rights to these vocals, and then set the music using looped samples of both hip hop and traditional folk instruments. The quintessential folkhop artist is the bedroom DJ. Folkhop albums typically feature no credits on musicians, instead liner notes simply feature 'big ups' to online friends of the folkhop DJ. Whereas Bhangra music was centered on bands delivering live performances with focus on instrumentation (as evidenced by Bhangra videos), folkhop shares with rap and hip hop \"common textual aspects, as well as similarities in their onstage and video performance practices: an obsession with materialism, or an expressed desire or boasting of \"bling\", in the form of jewelry, wealth or clothing\" It also features an obsession with farming and rural lifestyle such as livestock, tractors traditional clothes etc. Many folkhop videos showcase rappers and folk singers in the midst of farms or riding on tractors."

      "description": "\"Santa Lucia\" ([ˈsanta luˈtʃiːa], [ˈsandə luˈʃiːə]) is a traditional Neapolitan song. It was transcribed by Teodoro Cottrau (1827–1879) and published by the Cottrau firm, as a \"barcarolla\", at Naples in 1849. Cottrau translated it from Neapolitan into Italian during the first stage of the Risorgimento, the first Neapolitan song to be given Italian lyrics. Its transcriber, who is very often credited as its composer, was the son of the French-born Italian composer and collector of songs Guillaume Louis Cottrau (1797–1847). Various sources credit A. Longo with the music, 1835. The original lyrics of \"Santa Lucia\" celebrate the picturesque waterfront district, Borgo Santa Lucia, in the Bay of Naples, in the invitation of a boatman to take a turn in his boat, to better enjoy the cool of the evening. In the United States, an early edition of the song, with an English translation by Thomas Oliphant, was published by M. McCaffrey, Baltimore. Perhaps the definitive 20th century recording of the song was that of Enrico Caruso, the great Neapolitan opera singer. The song was also recorded by Elvis Presley on the 1965 album Elvis for Everyone and featured in the film Viva Las Vegas. In Sweden, Finland, Denmark, the Faroe Islands, and Norway, \"Santa Lucia\" has been given various lyrics to accommodate it to the winter-light festival of Saint Lucy, at the darkest time of the year. The three most famous lyrics versions in Swedish are Luciasången, also known by its incipit, Sankta Lucia, ljusklara hägring (“Saint Lucy, bright illusion”); Natten går tunga fjät (“The night walks with heavy steps”); and the 1970s \"kindergarten\" version, Ute är mörkt och kallt (“Outside it’s dark and cold”). The more common Norwegian version is Svart senker natten seg (\"Black the night descends\"). In the Czech Republic (or former Czechoslovakia), it was made famous with the words Krásná je Neapol sung by Waldemar Matuška. In Thailand a Thai translation, Silpakorn Niyom (ศิลปากรนิยม), is the anthem of Silpakorn University; the founder of the university, Silpa Bhirasri, was Italian."

Due to the sheer scale of the United Kingdom rave scene, the popularity of this particular music was largely limited to England where it was almost exclusively produced and played. Breakbeat hardcore was originally referred to as hardcore by ravers in England. As such, this evolved style was also alternatively known as hardcore or happy hardcore — the latter meaning a happier variant of this breakbeat styled hardcore, thus happy hardcore (i.e. happy breakbeat). Darkcore was the short lived counter-movement to happy that occurred at the same time. The name happy hardcore should not be confused with other things that are also referred to as happy hardcore, as that term is much shared across the world to describe different sounding things that have their own development. Also in this article, 4-beat is not a musical term commonly used to describe a drum beat time signature found in most types of modern music, but is rather a specific name used to describe a breakbeat music style.",

It also describes Logan's death at the hands of local Aborigines and the joy felt by the convicts upon hearing the news. The song may have been composed at the time of Logan's death on or soon after 18 October 1830. A version entitled The Convict's Arrival or The Convict's Lament on the Death of Captain Logan has been attributed to Francis MacNamara who was transported to Australia in 1832 and was never held at Moreton Bay.

Meilhac and Halévy's libretto lampoons both serious (Schiller's play set to music by Verdi) and light theatre (Fra Diavolo and Les diamants de la couronne by Auber). The plot is cheerfully amoral in its presentation of theft as a basic principle of society rather than as an aberration. As Falsacappa, the brigand chieftain, notes: \"Everybody steals according to their position in society\". The piece premiered in Paris in 1869 and has received periodic revivals in France and elsewhere, both in French and in translation. Les brigands has a more substantial plot than many Offenbach operettas and integrates the songs more completely into the story. The forces of law and order are represented by the bumbling carabinieri, who always arrive too late to capture the thieves, and whose exaggerated attire delighted the Parisian audience during the premiere. In addition to policemen, financiers receive satiric treatment. The satire is a pretext for joyful musical romps and the frequent Italian and Spanish rhythms are more real than in real life; \"Soyez pitoyables\" is a true canon, and each act finale is a well-developed whole. A 1983 New York Times, article concluded that the music of the piece seems to have influenced Bizet in writing Carmen and noted that the librettists for this work supplied Bizet's libretto, but standard Offenbach references do not mention any such influence."

(The character of Don César de Bazan first appeared in Victor Hugo's Ruy Blas.) The first of six operas by Wallace, the work is often cited as an inspiration for a plot device in Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera The Yeomen of the Guard in which a man weds a woman while awaiting execution in prison, escapes and, while he is disguised, the couple falls in love."

Japanese hip hop generally tends to be most directly influenced by old school hip hop, taking from the era's catchy beats, dance culture, and overall fun and carefree nature and incorporating it into their music. As a result, hip hop stands as one of the most commercially viable mainstream music genres in Japan, and the line between it and pop music is frequently blurred.",

According to both Pitchfork and NME, proto-gothic bands include Joy Division, Siouxsie and the Banshees Bauhaus, and the Cure. The genre itself was defined as a separate movement from post-punk due to its darker music accompanied by introspective and romantic lyrics. Gothic rock then gave rise to a broader subculture that included clubs, fashion and publications in the 1980s.",

      "description": "Bastien und Bastienne (Bastien and Bastienne), K. 50 (revised in 1964 to K. 46b) is a one-act singspiel, a comic opera, by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Bastien und Bastienne was one of Mozart's earliest operas, written in 1768 when he was only twelve years old. It was allegedly commissioned by Viennese physician and 'magnetist' Dr. Franz Mesmer (who himself would later be parodied in Così fan tutte) as a satire of the 'pastoral' genre then prevalent, and specifically as a parody of the opera Le devin du village by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. The German libretto is by Friedrich Wilhelm Weiskern, Johann Heinrich Friedrich Müller and Johann Andreas Schachtner, based on Les Amours de Bastien et Bastienne by Justine Favart and Harny de Guerville. After its supposed premiere in Mesmer's garden theater (that is only corroborated by an unverified account of Nissen), it was not revived again until 1890. It is not clear whether this piece was performed in Mozart's lifetime. The first known performance was on 2 October 1890 at Architektenhaus in Berlin. The opera is written in both French and German manners. Many of the melodies are French in manner, but Bastienne's first aria is true German lied. This melody is also used in Mozart's Trio in G for Piano, Violin and Violoncello, K. 564 (1788). Another purely German lied is Bastienne's aria \"I feel certain of his heart\". Mozart utilizes the orchestra sparingly, with the exception of the reconciliation scene. Mozart's overture uses the same opening theme as Beethoven's Symphony No. 3, the Eroica. It is doubtful that Beethoven was familiar with this then unpublished piece. A likely explanation is that both composers took the theme from another unknown source. Although he was very young, Mozart already had excellent vocal writing skills and a knack for parody and whimsy which would reach full flower in his later works. Bastien und Bastienne is possibly the easiest to perform of Mozart's juvenile works."

The chant called for her to be removed from that role. It was referred to, in that context, during a parliamentary session in 1984. When Margaret Thatcher felt compelled to resign some people had memories of chanting it for thirteen years. People were passionate about this group activity and associated it with varied political struggles from that time. It is a variant of the \"Oggy Oggy Oggy, Oi Oi Oi\" chant. When used in that format, the lyrics were: The chorus of the chant became the title of a compilation album from Anagram Records (Catalog#:GRAM 28) released in 1987. The Larks produced a track called \"Maggie, Maggie, Maggie (Out, Out, Out)\" which was included on the Miners’ Benefit LP “Here We Go” on Sterile Records. Comedian Alexei Sayle remarked humorously that he couldn't find his way around London unless he walked down the middle of the streets shouting the words.[citation needed] Since 1990 two variants of this song have been heard - adapted for both her successors; replacing 'Major' for 'Maggie' during the tenure of John Major and 'Tony' for 'Maggie' since Tony Blair's plan for the Iraq War in 2003.[citation needed] The song has occasionally been revived to \"greet\" Thatcher's public outings following her resignation as Prime Minister, but with the word \"gone\" substituted for \"out\".[citation needed] Following the death of Thatcher on 8 April 2013, this chant was revived in the format of \"Maggie, Maggie Maggie (Dead, Dead, Dead)\" at celebratory parties held in Glasgow and Brixton."

It is a tradition that can be defined by eight socio-musical elements: mariachi instrumentation and texture, musical genres and sub genres, performance methods and styles, singing styles and forms, dance styles, performative space, performance clothing, and the word \"mariachi\". Each element has its own history, originated at varying moments in time and in different regions of the Western Mexican countryside, and some, not all, had to have converged in order for the mariachi tradition to be what it has become. From the 19th to 20th century, migrations from rural areas into cities such as Guadalajara and Mexico City, along with the Mexican government's cultural promotion gradually re-labeled it as Son style, with its alternative name of “mariachi” becoming used for the “urban” form. Modifications of the music include influences from other music such as polkas and waltzes, the addition of trumpets and the use of charro outfits by mariachi musicians. The musical style began to take on national prominence in the first half of the 20th century, with its promotion at presidential inaugurations and on the radio in the 1920s. In 2011 UNESCO recognized mariachi as an Intangible Cultural Heritage, joining six others of this list from Mexico.",

Bartók initially planned to write a single-movement concerto set of variations, but Zoltán Székely wanted a standard three-movement concerto. In the end, Székely received his three movements, while Bartók received his variations (the second movement being possibly the most formal set of variations Bartók wrote in his career, and the third movement being a variation on material from the first). Though not employing twelve-tone technique the piece contains twelve-tone themes, such as in the first and third movements: The work was premiered at the Concertgebouw, Amsterdam on March 23, 1939 with Zoltán Székely on violin and Willem Mengelberg conducting the Concertgebouw Orchestra. It had its United States premiere in Cleveland, Ohio in 1943, with Tossy Spivakovsky on the violin accompanied by The Cleveland Orchestra conducted by Artur Rodziński.

Mozart wrote it in Munich in January 1775 when he was 18 years old and it received its first performance on January 13 at the Salvator theater in Munich. There is debate over the authorship of the libretto; often ascribed to Calzabigi, some have attributed it to Giuseppe Petrosellini, but it is questioned whether it is in the latter's style. In 1780 Mozart converted the opera into a German Singspiel called Die Gärtnerin aus Liebe (also Die verstellte Gärtnerin), which involved rewriting some of the music. Until a copy of the complete Italian version was found in the 1970s, the German translation was the only known complete score."

The mod revival's mainstream popularity was relatively short, although its influence has lasted for decades. The mod revival post-dated a Teddy Boy revival, and mod revivalists sometimes clashed with Teddy Boy revivalists, skinhead revivalists, casuals, punks and rival gang members. The late 1970s mod revival was led by the band The Jam, who had adopted a stark mod look and mixed the energy of punk with the sound of 1960s mod bands. The mod revival was a conscious effort to harken back to an earlier generation in terms of style. In the early 1980s in the UK, a mod revival scene influenced by the original 1960s mod subculture developed.",

      "description": "\"This Land Is Your Land\" is one of the United States' most famous folk songs. Its lyrics were written by American folk singer Woody Guthrie in 1940 based on an existing melody, in critical response to Irving Berlin's \"God Bless America\", which Guthrie considered unrealistic and complacent. Tired of hearing Kate Smith sing it on the radio, he wrote a response originally called \"God Blessed America\". Guthrie varied the lyrics over time, sometimes including more overtly political verses in line with his sympathetic views of communism than appear in recordings or publications. Guthrie wrote the song in 1940 and recorded it in 1944. The song was not published until 1945, when it was included in a mimeographed booklet of ten songs with typed lyrics and hand drawings. The booklet was sold for twenty-five cents, and was copyrighted in 1951. The first known professionally printed publication was in 1956 by Ludlow Music (now a unit of The Richmond Organization), which administered the publishing rights to Guthrie's song. Ludlow later issued versions with piano and guitar accompaniments. In 2002, it was one of 50 recordings chosen that year by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry."

      "description": "\"Crawford’s Defeat by the Indians\" is an early American folk ballad principally written by Doctor John Knight, survivor of the 1782 Crawford Expedition. The expedition was intended to destroy American Indian towns along the Sandusky River and was one of the final operations of the American Revolutionary War. The ballad, \"Crawford's Defeat,\" contains a great deal more history than poetry, however. It was long after a favorite song upon the frontier and was sung to various tunes. In fact, Doctor Knight's narrative was an immediate success. Its depiction of a brave officer's death at the hands of fiendish savages drew wide admiration and scenes of a rolling landscape delighted eastern land speculators. Though a year elapsed before Indian Atrocities: Narratives of the Perils and Sufferings of Dr. Knight and John Slover was printed, the delay apparently did nothing to reduce its appeal. If anything, the delay probably increased public interest, for all the while the ballad, \"Crawford's Defeat,\" was being sung. Another ballad, titled \"Saint Clair's Defeat\", was later based on \"Crawford's Defeat\". It depicts the Battle of the Wabash, which was fought on November 4, 1791, in the Northwest Territory between the United States and the Western Confederacy of American Indians."

The piece was Sousa's first successful operetta and his most successful stage work. The march \"El Capitan\" became a standard work both for brass bands and a crossover into other genres. El Capitan was first produced at the Tremont Theatre in Boston, beginning on April 13, 1896. After this tryout, it transferred to the old Broadway Theatre on 41st Street in New York on April 20, 1896, where it ran for 112 performances, starring DeWolf Hopper, Edna Wallace Hopper, John Parr, and Alfred Klein. It then toured almost continuously for four years in the United States and Canada and was quickly revived on Broadway. It was produced at the Lyric Theatre in London beginning on July 10, 1899, where it ran for 140 performances. Thereafter, the operetta was produced numerous times internationally and remained popular for some time. Occasional modern performances continue. For example, Lake George Opera gave a production in 2009, and Ohio Light Opera presented and recorded the work during the summer of 2010. El Capitan also refers to the march of the same name, composed of themes from the operetta. This march is like other operetta marches (1897's Bride Elect, 1900's Man Behind the Gun, and 1906's Free Lance) with its use of both 6/8 (parts A and B) and 2/4 (parts C and D) sections. Also like the Bride Elect and Man Behind the Gun this march has an introduction between part C and D. It follows style IAABBCCIDD. The march also influenced \"El Capitan\" by Memphis Slim and the mambo \"El Capitan\" by Tony Pabon."

Felice Romani wrote the Italian libretto after Ippolito Pindemonte's Enrico VIII ossia Anna Bolena and Alessandro Pepoli's Anna Bolena, both recounting the life of Anne Boleyn, the second wife of England's King Henry VIII. It is one of four operas by Donizetti dealing with the Tudor period in English history—in composition order, Il castello di Kenilworth (1829), Anna Bolena (1830), Maria Stuarda (named for Mary, Queen of Scots, it appeared in different forms in 1834 and 1835), and Roberto Devereux (1837, named for a putative lover of Queen Elizabeth I of England). The leading female characters of the latter three operas are often referred to as \"the Three Donizetti Queens.\" The duet \"Sul suo capo aggravi un Dio\" between Anna (soprano) and Jane Seymour (mezzo soprano), who later became Henry VIII's third wife, is considered one of the finest in the entire operatic repertoire. Anna Bolena premiered on 26 December 1830 at the Teatro Carcano in Milan, to \"overwhelming success.\" Weinstock notes that only after this success did Donizetti's teacher, Johann Simon Mayr, \"address his former pupil as Maestro.\" The composer had begun \"to emerge as one of three most luminous names in the world of Italian opera\", alongside Bellini and Rossini."

      "description": "Il trovatore ([il trovaˈtoːre]; Italian for \"The Troubadour\") is an opera in four acts by Giuseppe Verdi to an Italian libretto largely written by Salvadore Cammarano, based on the play El trovador (1836) by Antonio García Gutiérrez. It was Gutiérrez's most successful play, one which Verdi scholar Julian Budden describes as \"a high flown, sprawling melodrama flamboyantly defiant of the Aristotelian unities, packed with all manner of fantastic and bizarre incident.\" The premiere took place at the Teatro Apollo in Rome on 19 January 1853, where it \"began a victorious march throughout the operatic world,\" a success due to Verdi's work over the previous three years. It began with his January 1850 approach to Cammarano with the idea of Il trovatore. There followed, slowly and with interruptions, the preparation of the libretto, first by Cammarano until his death in mid-1852 and then with the young librettist Leone Emanuele Bardare, which gave the composer the opportunity to propose significant revisions, which were accomplished under his direction. These revisions are seen largely in the expansion of the role of Leonora. For Verdi, the three years were filled with operatic activity because work on this opera did not proceed while the composer wrote and premiered Rigoletto in Venice in March 1851 and also while his personal affairs limited his activities. Then, in May 1851, an additional commission was offered by the Venice company after Rigoletto's success there. Then another came from Paris while he was visiting that city from late 1851 and into March 1852. Therefore, even before the libretto for Il trovatore was ever completed, before the music was written, and before the opera premiered, Verdi had a total of four different operatic projects underway and in various stages of development. Today, in its Italian version, Trovatore is given very frequently and is a staple of the standard operatic repertoire."

Torvaldo e Dorliska is a rescue opera with an eventual happy ending. The inclusion of buffo roles is the reason for its designation as a 'semiserio' work, similar to Rossini's La gazza ladra."

The Romo movement was essentially a derivation of late-1970s disco and early-1980s club music, with an emphasis on the extroverted sartorial style and decadent air of New Romantic-era bands such as Japan and Soft Cell. Nonetheless, contemporary features in Melody Maker (where the genre was championed mainly by Simon Price and Taylor Parkes – it was dismissed by the rival NME) tended to downplay the nostalgic connection with New Romantic, emphasising Romo's newness and contemporary relevance. Much championed by the aforesaid writers at the Melody Maker as a stylish and poppy backlash against the dressed-down style of the Britpop movement, while variously feted and lambasted by others in the media as a New Romantic revival (a tag rejected by those on the scene) Romo's prime legacy has been chiefly in club culture as it heralded a new generation of glam/style orientated club nights which would continue through the 2000s.",

It was premiered in late May 1690 at the Queen's Theatre, Dorset Garden. The play was first produced in 1622. [??] Choreography for the various dances was provided by Josias Priest, who worked with Purcell on several other semi-operas. Betterton reworked the play extensively, making room for a great deal of Purcell's music, notably in the 'monster' scene at the end of Act II and the final Masque about the victory of Love, which remained popular until well into the eighteenth century. The premier production had a Prologue written by John Dryden that was suppressed after only one performance; it was far too critical of King William's military campaign in Ireland."

      "description": "Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten (About this sound sample ) is a short canon in A minor, written in 1977 by the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt, for string orchestra and bell. The work is an early example of Pärt's tintinnabuli style, which he based on his reactions to early chant music. Its appeal is often ascribed to its relative simplicity; a single melodic motif dominates and it both begins and ends with scored silence. However, as the critic Ivan Hewett observes, while it \"may be simple in concept...the concept produces a tangle of lines which is hard for the ear to unravel. And even where the music really is simple in its audible features, the expressive import of those features is anything but.\" A typical performance lasts about six and a half minutes. The cantus was composed as an elegy to mourn the December 1976 death of the English composer Benjamin Britten. Pärt greatly admired Britten. Pärt described Britten as possessing the \"unusual purity\" that he himself sought as a composer. Pärt viewed the Englishman as a kindred spirit; however, he gained access to the latter's music only in 1980, after emigrating from Soviet Estonia to Austria, four years after Britten had died.[citation needed] When Britten died, Pärt felt that he had lost hope of meeting the only contemporary composer whose musical outlook, he believed, resembled his own.[citation needed] Although Pärt is known primarily for his religious music, Cantus is a fully secular work, in that it forms a spare lament to a fellow composer not based on biblical texts. It is perhaps Pärt's most popular piece, and a 1997 recording by the Hungarian State Opera Orchestra conducted by Tamas Benedek has been widely distributed. Due to its evocative and cinematic feel, the piece has been used extensively as background accompaniment in both film and television documentaries."

The word \"crepusculum,\" is Latin for \"twilight,\" signaling the influence of Richard Wagner's tetrology Der Ring des Nibelungen (whose fourth installment is called \"Twilight of the Gods\" (Gotterdammerung)). The remaining two operas were never completed. Leoncavallo sought to create an \"epic poem\" for the stage. However, one contemporary review of the premiere stated: \"In I Medici we have a historical opera like those that have been made many times before and will be hence ... [but] we do not have either an epoch or a set of characters brought truthfully to life; we do not have, in a word, that counterpart of the mythic trilogy [sic] of Wagner at which Leoncavallo has gazed.\" (\"In I Medici abbiamo un'opera su sfondo storico come ce ne furono tante prima e come ce ne saranno dopo ... non abbiamo né un'epoca né un complesso di figure vive e vere; non abbiamo, in una parola, quel contrapposto umano alla trilogia mitica del Wagner a cui il Leoncavallo ha mirato.\")."

Keiser's Croesus received its first performance at the Theater am Gänsemarkt, Hamburg, in 1711 (exact date unknown). Later, the composer extensively revised the opera for a new version, which premièred at the same theatre on 6 December 1730. In the process, he discarded much of the original material, and, in consequence, only the 1730 version has survived in complete form. The first performance in modern times was given in 1990 at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris (conductor René Clemencic), and first full performance in turn was given in 1999 at the Berlin State Opera (conductor: René Jacobs). The first British performance was given, in English, by Opera North on 17 October 2007, at the Grand Theatre, Leeds. It was conducted by Harry Bicket, designed by Leslie Travers and directed by Tim Albery.

In addition, it is perhaps the most flexible of all forms of Latin-American music, and is the foundation of many Cuban-based dance forms, and salsa. Its great strength is its fusion between European and African musical traditions. The son arose in Oriente, merging the Spanish guitar and lyrical traditions with Afro-Cuban percussion and rhythms. We now know that its history as a distinct form is relatively recent. There is no evidence that it goes back further than the end of the nineteenth century. It moved from Oriente to Havana in about 1909, carried by members of the Permanent (the Army), who were sent out of their areas of origin as a matter of policy. The first recordings were in 1918. There are many types of son, of which the son montuno is one. The term has been used in several ways. Probably the 'montuno' originally referred to its origin in the mountainous regions of eastern Cuba; eventually it was used more to describe the final up-tempo section of a son, with its semi-improvisation, repetitive vocal refrain and brash instrumental climax. The term was being used in the 1920s, when son sextetos set up in Havana and competed strongly with the older danzones.",

The title of the song references the Scotch Broom (Cytisus scoparius) flower, a vibrant yellow flower found throughout Scotland, including in Cowdenknowes, in Berwickshire. The original and extended ballad was the story of a young shepherdess who falls in love with a stranger on horseback, who rides by her pasture every day. The song became popular across Scotland and England towards the end of the reign of James l & VI, and the earliest publication date found is 1651. The melody was also published as a dance tune, during the same year, in John Playford's first edition of The English Dancing Master. Throughout the many versions of the popular folksong, there are many lyrical variations, but the plot remain consistent. The shepardess and stranger fall in love and have an affair. When she becomes pregnant, she is banished from her country. She seeks out her lover, finding him to now be a wealthy lord. They marry, but she is never truly happy away from her own country, and she pines for \"the bonnie bonnie broom\". Traditionally, the song is sung from the perspective of the shepherdess. The broom, a tall shrub which blooms with spikes of small golden flowers, once grew abundantly on hillsides of the Scottish Borders. Cowdenknowes is a Scottish barony east of the Leader Water river, 32 miles southeast of Edinburgh."

The cantata is structured in six movements: two choral movements at the beginning and end frame a sequence of alternating recitatives and arias. The opening movement is based on a verse from Psalm 139; the closing chorale on a stanza from Johann Heermann's hymn \"Wo soll ich fliehen hin\".

This carol and its melody were first transcribed from the singing of Thomas Beard, a villager in St Day in the parish of Gwennap, Cornwall. The fourth verse is a translation from the Cornish version, \"Ma gron war'n gelln\". The lyrics are similar to those of \"The Holly and the Ivy\" and it is no. 35 in the Oxford Book of Carols."

      "description": "Gallantry is a one act opera by composer Douglas Moore. The work is a parody of soap opera, complete with sung commercial interruptions. The work uses an English language libretto by Arnold Sundgaard. The opera premiered in a double bill with Dominick Argento's The Boor on March 19, 1958, in New York City at the now-destroyed Brander Matthews Theater on 117th Street, between Amsterdam Avenue and Morningside Drive. It was presented by the Columbia University School of Music with a student cast. It has subsequently been staged by several other university opera theatre programs in the United States and Canada, including UCLA (1958, 1974, and 1994), Immaculate Heart College (1968), Goucher College (1969), the University of Michigan (1978), the University of Toronto (1988), San Diego State University (1989), Pepperdine University (1990), Wilfrid Laurier University (1992), the University of Arizona (1995), George Washington University (1999), and the University of Wisconsin (2003) among others. The University of Southern California toured the opera to the Netherlands in 1968. The first professional opera company to stage Gallantry was the Detroit Opera, which presented the work in a double bill with Gian Carlo Menotti's The Medium in January 1962. Gallantry was adapted by Moore for television and was broadcast by CBS on August 30, 1962, in a program which also included a presentation of Wallingford Riegger's ballet Parallels. The production was produced by Pamela Illott, directed by Martin Carr, hosted by Jan Peerce, and featured the CBS Symphony Orchestra. It starred Laurel Hurley as the Nurse, Ron Holgate as the Surgeon, Charles Anthony as the Patient, and Martha Wright as the Announcer. The opera was staged at the 1967 Florida International Music Festival in Daytona Beach with Metropolitan Opera performers Carol Courtman, Julian Patrick, and Enrico Di Giuseppe. The opera was subsequently staged by the Canadian Opera Company (1977) and the Lake George Opera (1986). More recently the opera has been of interest to chamber opera ensembles, with productions being staged by the American Chamber Opera Company (1988), A Small Company In America (1990), the New York Chamber Ensemble (1991), and Pocket Opera (2000)."

A two-verse fragment of the song is found in the Scottish manuscript collection of the 1770s of David Herd. This was used by Robert Burns as the basis for his poem \"Lady Mary Ann\" (published 1792). The subject of the song is an arranged marriage of a young girl by her father to a boy who is even younger than she. There are numerous versions of both the tune and lyrics. In one set of lyrics the groom is twelve when he marries and a father at 13. According to Roud and Bishop:"

The work is dedicated to the composer's friend and Colleague Henri Sauguet, who had arranged for Tailleferre to spend a month at the Chateau de Rondon in Brittany, which was run by the SACD (the French Dramatic Rights Organization) which he presided. Written in three movements, the work lasts about twelve minutes to perform. The first and second movements use themes from Tailleferre's 1951 Comic Opera Il était un petit navire. A version for Violin (oboe), Viola, Violoncello and Piano has been performed by the Ambache ensemble during 2005. A version for three winds and string orchestra, cited by Georges Hacquard in \"Germaine Tailleferre: La Dame des Six\" (L'Harmattan, 1997) as the work of Germaine Tailleferre has been proven to be the work of Michel Rothenbühler, a music teacher at the Ecole Alsacienne where Mr. Hacquard was head-master.

      "description": "The Symphony No. 53 in D major, Hoboken I/53, is a symphony by Joseph Haydn. It is often referred to by the subtitle \"L'Impériale\". The symphony was composed by 1777. It is scored for flute, two oboes, bassoon, two horns, timpani, and strings. The work is in four movements: The second movement is in double variation form beginning and ending in A major with the second theme in A minor. There are actually two other versions of the Finale. Haydn took the overture to an unknown opera which began in C major, and truncated the last dozen measures so as to conclude in D major. H. C. Robbins Landon has postulated that Haydn did not compose the third version of the Finale, but that instead another composer, hired by the publisher Sieber, was responsible. The Eulenburg edition, edited by Robbins Landon, includes both of Haydn's finales. The surviving autograph score of the second Finale had no flute or timpani parts, so Robbins Landon took them from a Hummel edition. For the timpani part there are rolls indicated by \"tr\" and a wavy line (something which occurs in none of the other movements except by Robbins Landon's editorial emendation in bar 16 of the first movement). L.P. Burstein has noted Haydn's use of the VII♯ chord and the VII♯ → V progression in the fourth movement, second (\"B\") version."

      "description": "Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky composed his Pezzo capriccioso, Op. 62, for cello and orchestra in a single week in August 1887. Belying its title, this work is written in the somber key of B minor, the same key as the Symphony No. 6 Pathétique. The Pezzo is not capricious in a lighthearted sense. The capriccioso aspect comes from Tchaikovsky's fanciful treatment of various aspects of the work's simple theme. Despite some rapid passages and a turn to the major key, Tchaikovsky preserves the basic pulse and sober mood throughout the piece. The sobriety was a result of Tchaikovsky's sufferings with his friend Nikolay Kondratyev. Kondratyev was in the final throes of syphilis. After a brief remission, he had been taken to Aachen, Germany, where his family hoped the mineral waters there would prolong his life at least a few months. Instead, Kondratyev had taken a turn for the worse. Moreover, he proved a highly unpredictable, volatile and demanding patient, which unnerved the already death-shy Tchaikovsky. A visit to see friends in Paris—among them cellist Anatoliy Brandukov—proved only a brief respite. All this suffering poured through the music Tchaikovsky was writing, as well. Tchaikovsky wrote Brandukov on August 25, \"I have written a small cello piece, and would like you to look through it, and put the final touches to the cello part.\" Two days later he had begun to make the piano score of the piece, and on 31st he began orchestrating it. The first performance of the Pezzo capriccioso, in its arrangement for piano accompaniment, took place on February 28, 1888 [O.S. February 16] at the home of M. P. Benardaky, during Tchaikovsky's visit to Paris. Brandukov was soloist, with the composer at the keyboard. The first performance of the orchestral version was given by Brandukov in Moscow at a special concert of the Russian Musical Society on November 25, 1889. Tchaikovsky conducted the orchestra. P. Jurgenson published the Pezzo capriccioso in 1888—the orchestral parts in January, and the arrangement for cello with piano in March. Publication of the full score was delayed because Tchaikovsky had taken the manuscript abroad with him, and did not return it to Jurgenson until May 6, 1888. The full score was printed in July the same year."

The symphony does not appear on concert programs very often, yet many recent scholars have ranked it among the composer’s finest scores. Although some[who?] have argued that the work falls within the tradition of other C minor \"tragedy to triumph\" symphonies, such as Beethoven's Fifth, Brahms' First, Bruckner's Eighth, and Mahler's Second, there is considerable disagreement over the level of optimism present in the final pages. Shostakovich's friend Isaak Glikman called this symphony \"his most tragic work\". The work like many of his symphonies breaks some of the standard conventions of symphonic form and structure. Shostakovich clearly references themes, rhythms and harmonies from his previous symphonies, most notably his Fifth Symphony and his Seventh Symphony."

According to the Rolling Stone Album Guide, \"the Minneapolis sound... loomed over mid-'80s R&B and pop, not to mention the next two decades' worth of electro, house, and techno.\" Prince's third album Dirty Mind from 1980 also earns credit. Pepe Willie, who brought his brand of music to Minneapolis from Brooklyn, New York, in the mid-'70s, is credited with being the first to bring Prince into the studio professionally to play on his group, 94 East's, demo. Owen Husney, Prince's first manager is credited with managing many of the Minneapolis artists at the time, recording them in his American Artists studio, and securing contracts for them with major labels. Some artists who came from Minnesota were influenced by Prince's work and some came from other parts of the U.S. or world, such as Scottish star Sheena Easton, Flint, Michigan's Ready for the World and Los Angeles, California's Cherrelle. The music is also known as a form of funk rock.",

When Francesco Tortoli was interested in producing it in Naples, it was determined that L'ajo nell'imbarazzo was unsuitable as it stood. Donizetti then signed a contract with Tortoli for 300 ducats to adapt it into a new opera, Don Gregorio, and to compose one further opera. For the adaptation, Donizetti composed some additional music, revised the recitatives into spoken dialogue, and translated the role of Don Gregorio into the Neapolitan dialect. The opera premiered at the Teatro Nuovo on 11 June 1826."

The Metropolitan Opera had commissioned the work from Corigliano in 1980 in celebration of its 100th anniversary, with the premiere scheduled for 1983. Corigliano and Hoffman took as the starting point for the opera the play La Mère coupable (The Guilty Mother) by Pierre Beaumarchais. They took seven years to complete the opera, past the initial deadline. The opera received its premiere on December 19, 1991, at the Metropolitan Opera, with the production directed by Colin Graham. The premiere run of seven performances was sold out. The original cast included Teresa Stratas, Håkan Hagegård, Renée Fleming, Graham Clark, Gino Quilico, and Marilyn Horne. The Metropolitan Opera revived the opera in the 1994/1995 season. Corigliano considers this work a \"grand opera buffa\" because it incorporates both elements of the Grand Opera style (large chorus numbers, special effects) and the silliness of the opera buffa style.

It remains primarily popular in the area as a uniquely regional music style. A great number of bands contributed to the early evolution of the genre, but the Young Senators, Black Heat, and singer-guitarist Chuck Brown and the Soul Searchers are credited with having developed most of the hallmarks of the style. Inspired by artists such as the groups mentioned above, go-go is a blend of funk, rhythm and blues, and early hip-hop, with a focus on lo-fi percussion instruments and funk-style jamming in place of dance tracks, although some sampling is used. As such, it is primarily a dance hall music with an emphasis on live audience call and response. Go-go rhythms are also incorporated into street percussion. In technical terms, \"Go-go's essential beat is characterized by a syncopated, dotted rhythm that consists of a series of quarter and eighth notes (quarter, eighth, quarter, (space/held briefly), quarter, eighth, quarter)... which is underscored most dramatically by the bass drum and snare drum, and the hi-hat... [and] is ornamented by the other percussion instruments, especially by the conga drums, timbales, and hand-held cowbells.\" Unique to go-go is an instrumentation with 3 standard Congas and 2 \"Junior Congas\", 8\" and 9\" wide and about half as tall as the standard Congas, a size rare outside of go-go. They were introduced to Rare Essence by Tyrone Williams -aka- Jungle Boogie in the early days when they couldn't afford enough full sized Congas, and are ubiquitous ever since.A swing rhythm is often implied (if not explicitly stated).",

It was written and produced by Gaga, Martin Kierszenbaum, and Space Cowboy, who also provides guest vocals. Musically, \"Christmas Tree\" is a Christmas song with dance-pop and synthpop influences. It samples the classic Christmas song \"Deck the Halls\", as well as briefly using the lyrics \"Rum pum pum pum\" from the Christmas song \"The Little Drummer Boy\" in its intro. Lyrically, the song uses sexual innuendos. The song received mixed reviews from music critics, with some commending its creativity and individuality from other Christmas songs and others criticizing its sexual innuendos and deeming it \"not for the family\". Due to strong digital sells, it reached number 79 on the Canadian Hot 100 in January 2009. It also reached number 18 on the Japanese RIAJ Digital Track Chart and number 23 on the Billboard Holiday/Seasonal Digital Songs chart in late 2010. In December 2009, it was available for free download on Amazon as a part of their \"25 Days of Free\" promotion. It has been included in several Christmas compilation albums, including Now That's What I Call Christmas! 4."

      "description": "Artaserse is an opera (dramma per musica) in three acts composed by Leonardo Vinci to an Italian libretto by Metastasio. This was the first of many musical settings of arguably Metastasio's most popular libretto, and Vinci and Metastasio were known to have collaborated closely for the world premiere of the opera in Rome. This was the last opera Vinci composed before his death, and also considered to be his masterpiece, and is known among baroque opera enthusiasts for its florid vocal lines and taxing tessituras. It premiered during the carnival season on 4 February 1730 at the Teatro delle Dame in Rome. As women were banned from the opera stage in Rome in the 18th century, all the female roles in the original production were taken up by castrati. However, subsequent 18th-century productions outside Rome included women in the cast. Artaserse continued to be popular for a while after Vinci's death, but has since faded into obscurity. The first modern revial of Artaserse was staged at the Opéra national de Lorraine in Nancy on 2 November 2012, featuring Philippe Jaroussky as Artaserse, Max Emanuel Cenčić as Mandane, Juan Sancho as Artabano, Franco Fagioli as Arbace, Valer Barna-Sabadus as Semira and Yuriy Mynenko as Megabise. In honour of the single-sex casting at the original premiere, the revival was staged with an all-male cast, with countertenors cast in skirt roles to play the female characters in the opera."

The symphony's first movement moves from B minor (introduction) to E minor, and the work ends with a Rondo-Finale in C major. Thus, as Dika Newlin has pointed out, \"in this symphony Mahler returns to the ideal of 'progressive tonality' which he had abandoned in the Sixth\". The complexity of the work's tonal scheme was analysed in terms of \"interlocking structures\" by Graham George."

      "description": "A carnival song or canto carnascialesco (pl. canti carnascialeschi) was a late fifteenth- and early sixteenth-century song used to celebrate the carnival season in Florence, mainly the weeks preceding Lent and the Calendimaggio, which lasted from May 1 to June 24. The festivities included song and dance, usually performed or led by masked professionals. The carnival song was elaborated under the rule of Duke Lorenzo the Magnificent (1469–92) and the ducal court became more involved. Lorenzo wrote lyric poems designed to be sung by members of his court and of the city's guilds, whose members also sang their own songs, with lyrics drawn mostly from popular legend and daily life. These canti are the textual descendants of the caccia, a song form that was typically satiric and obscene, revelling in the double entendre. The musical settings were generally chordal and strophic (often ABBC), similar to the frottola, which was then popular in Mantua. The A and B stanzas were typically in common metre, the final stanza was then in perfect (i.e. 3/4) time. Performance outdoors and before popular audiences probably constrained the music to be simple and unsubtle. These songs were usually serenades, chariot songs, and processionals, often song from parade floats. Though we know that Heinrich Isaac composed canti carnascialeschi for Lorenzo around 1480, none of these works survive. One anonymous surviving song, Orsu car' Signori, is an advertisement paid for by the guild of scribes: \"Step up, dear sirs, if you wish your bulls quickly certified.\" The fate of many of the canti was sealed by the fall of the Medici and the Bonfire of the Vanities (and the like) under Girolamo Savonarola. Some melodies escaped destruction by being set to new (sacred) words. The canti, with the carnivals, were restored after Savonarola's downfall in 1498, but they were increasing ceremonial in character and the exercise of writing songs for them became more literary."

He composed the chorale cantata in Leipzig for the 20th Sunday after Trinity and first performed it on 22 October 1724. The cantata is based upon Johann Franck's hymn \"Schmücke dich, o liebe Seele\", with a melody by Johann Crüger, a hymn for the Eucharist. It matches the Sunday's prescribed reading, the Parable of the Great Banquet from the Gospel of Matthew. The first and last stanza are used unchanged in both text and tune: the former is treated as a chorale fantasia, the latter as a four-part closing chorale. An unknown librettist paraphrased the inner stanzas as recitatives and arias, quoting one stanza of the hymn within a recitative. Bach scored the cantata for four vocal soloists, a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of different flutes and oboes, strings and continuo. All movements are set in the major mode, in keeping with the festive text, and several movements resemble dances."

      "description": "Tancredi is a melodramma eroico (opera seria or 'heroic' opera) in two acts by composer Gioachino Rossini and librettist Gaetano Rossi (who was also to write Semiramide ten years later), based on Voltaire's play Tancrède (1760). The opera made its first appearance at the Teatro La Fenice in Venice on 6 February 1813, and because Il signor Bruschino premiered in late January, the composer must have completed Tancredi in less than a month. The overture, borrowed from La pietra del paragone, is a popular example of Rossini's characteristic style and is regularly performed in concert and recorded. Considered by Stendhal, Rossini's earliest biographer, to be \"high amongst the composer's masterworks\", and describing it as \"a genuine thunderbolt out of a clear, blue sky for the Italian lyric theatre,\" his librettist Gaetano Rossi notes that, with it, \"Rossini rose to glory\". Richard Osborne proclaims it to be \"his fully fledged opera seria and it established him, more of less instantly, as Italy's leading composer of contemporary opera.\" Although the original version had a happy ending (as required by the opera seria tradition), soon after the Venice premiere, Rossini — who was more of a Neo-classicist than a Romantic, notes Servadio — had the poet Luigi Lechi rework the libretto to emulate the original tragic ending by Voltaire. In this new ending, presented at the Teatro Comunale in Ferrara on 21 March 1813, Tancredi wins the battle but is mortally wounded, and only then does he learn that Amenaide never betrayed him. Argirio marries the lovers in time for Tancredi to die in his wife's arms. As has been stated by Philip Gossett and Patricia Brauner, it was the rediscovery of the score of this ending in 1974 (although elsewhere Gossett provides evidence that it was 1976) that resulted in the version which is usually performed today."

Given this background, and the fact that it was copied by Christian Friedrich Penzel, one of Bach's last students, there is a confusing variety of proposed composition dates.

Marked by experimentalist sensibilities and a desire to break with tradition, post-punk artists embraced non-rock genres previously reviled by punk, such electronic music and various black dance styles, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of high and popular culture, with artists incorporating the influence of visual art, radical politics, modernist literature and the avant-garde. Accompanying these musical developments were subcultures that produced art, independent record labels, multimedia performances and fanzines in conjunction with the music. The early post-punk vanguard included groups such as Siouxsie and the Banshees, Wire, Public Image Ltd, Joy Division, Talking Heads, Throbbing Gristle, Scritti Politti and The Contortions. The development of the post-punk scene was also closely related to that of genres such as gothic rock, no wave and industrial music. Developing throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s. much of the movement had dissipated by 1985, eventually providing the impetus for the New Pop movement as well much subsequent alternative and independent music.",

      "description": "Midwest hip-hop is hip-hop music performed by artists from the Midwestern United States. In contrast with its East Coast, West Coast and Southern counterparts, Midwest hip hop has very few constants. Its first dose of national popularity came in the mid-90s with the extremely fast-paced rappers known as Choppers, such as Bone Thugs-n-Harmony (Cleveland), Twista (Chicago), Tech N9ne (Kansas City), Atmosphere (Minneapolis), and Eminem (Detroit). However, while the artists mentioned above became the first to introduce Midwest hip hop that rivaled the popularity of West and East Coast styles, subsequent acts have since risen to national prominence such as Nelly, D12, Common and Kanye West but they share very few similarities. Other notable midwest rappers and producers include: Brother Ali, Lupe Fiasco, Royce Da 5'9, J Dilla, Mac Lethal, Elzhi, Kid Cudi, Obie Trice, and up and comers Freddie Gibbs and Manny Phesto. It is because these lack of constants between acts from different cities (and sometimes even between artists from the same city) that it can be extremely difficult to define a \"typical\" Midwest sound. One characteristic of Midwest hip hop is that beat tempos can range from 90 to about 180, while East Coast's beat tempo is 90–120, West Coast is 100–120, and Southern rap is 80–180.",

      "description": "Reuben, Reuben is a 1955 \"urban folk opera\" by Marc Blitzstein. Set in New York's Little Italy and inspired by the Faust legend, it concerns Reuben, a suicidal veteran who has received a medical discharge because he cannot speak. His disorder serves as an allegory of the difficulties of interpersonal communication in society, and of the eventual triumph of love over these difficulties and over the death wish. The original cast included Eddie Albert as Reuben, Evelyn Lear as Reuben's love interest Nina, Kaye Ballard as the Countess, Enzo Stuarti as Attilio, George Gaynes as Bart, Sondra Lee as Gisella, and Timmy Everett as Blazer. Other cast members included Lear's husband Thomas Stewart, Allen Case, Emile Renan, William Pierson, and Anita Darian. Hanya Holm choreographed, Robert Lewis stage directed, and Cheryl Crawford produced the show. The opera's initial run, in Boston, was a failure: audience members left in the middle of the show, and critics panned it. Nevertheless, Leonard Bernstein named his daughter Nina after the play's heroine.

As of 2009, it is the only one of Mozart's symphonies published in the Alte Mozart-Ausgabe that has never been recorded. elative c { } The symphony is scored for two oboes, two horns and strings. In contemporary orchestras, it was also usual to include bassoons and harpsichord if they were available in the orchestra to reinforce the bass line and act as the continuo. The duration is approximately 12–15 minutes. The symphony consists of the following movements: In Vienna, an unknown person (possibly Franz Lorenz) compiled a \"Sistematisch-Thematisches Verzeichnis der sämtlichen Compositionen von Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (\"Systematic Thematic Catalogue of all composition by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\"). A pencil note \"1771 Milan Nov\" can be found for K. 98. Ludwig Ritter von Köchel, who only knew the work in an arrangement for two pianos, considered the work authentic and included it into the first edition of the Köchel catalogue. Wyzewa and Saint-Foix did not doubt the work's authenticity, but believed that Mozart only sketched the symphony and did not write it out completely. In his revision of Otto Jahn's Mozart biography Hermann Abert stated that the symphony was probably doubtful, listing many things uncharacteristic of Mozart's works and characteristic of other Mannheim composers, even noting a favourite phrase of Johann Stamitz in the beginning of the trio of the minuet. The symphony has been attributed to Joseph Haydn, Michael Haydn and Leopold Mozart. Neal Zaslaw states that its authorship remains uncertain. The Alte Mozart-Ausgabe (published 1879–1882) gives the numbering sequence 1–41 for the 41 numbered symphonies. The unnumbered symphonies (some, including K. 98, published in supplements to the Alte-Mozart Ausgabe until 1910) are sometimes given numbers in the range 42 to 56, even though they were written earlier than Mozart's Symphony No. 41 (written in 1788). The symphony K. 98 is given the number 56 in this numbering scheme."

Hebrews 10:22 is reported as being a source of inspiration for the hymn : - \"Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.\" (King James Version ) The original lyrics are as follows: - I am Thine, O Lord, I have heard Thy voice,And it told Thy love to me;But I long to rise in the arms of faithAnd be closer drawn to Thee. Refrain Draw me nearer, nearer blessèd Lord,To the cross where Thou hast died.Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer blessèd Lord,To Thy precious, bleeding side. Consecrate me now to Thy service, Lord,By the power of grace divine;Let my soul look up with a steadfast hope,And my will be lost in Thine. Refrain O the pure delight of a single hourThat before Thy throne I spend,When I kneel in prayer, and with Thee, my GodI commune as friend with friend! Refrain There are depths of love that I cannot knowTill I cross the narrow sea;There are heights of joy that I may not reachTill I rest in peace with Thee. Refrain Translations of the hymn exist in various languages: - \"Je suis Tien, Seigneur\" (French) \"Ich bin Dein, O Herr\" (German) \"Tuyo Soy, Jesús\" (Spanish) \"Jag är din, O Gud\" (Swedish) sv:Jag är din, o Gud"

      "description": "Western swing music is a subgenre of American country music that originated in the late 1920s in the West and South among the region's Western string bands. It is dance music, often with an up-tempo beat, which attracted huge crowds to dance halls and clubs in Texas, Oklahoma and California during the 1930s and 1940s until a federal war-time nightclub tax in 1944 led to its decline.[citation needed] The movement was an outgrowth of jazz, and similarities with gypsy jazz are often noted.[citation needed] The music is an amalgamation of rural, cowboy, polka, folk, Dixieland jazz and blues blended with swing; and played by a hot string band often augmented with drums, saxophones, pianos and, notably, the steel guitar. The electrically amplified stringed instruments, especially the steel guitar, give the music a distinctive sound. Later incarnations have also included overtones of bebop. Western swing differs in several ways from the music played by the nationally popular horn-driven big swing bands of the same era. In Western bands, even fully orchestrated bands, vocals, and other instruments followed the fiddle's lead. Additionally, although popular horn bands tended to arrange and score their music, most Western bands improvised freely, either by soloists or collectively. Prominent groups during the peak of Western swing's popularity included The Light Crust Doughboys, Bob Wills and The Texas Playboys, Milton Brown and His Musical Brownies, and Spade Cooley and His Orchestra. Contemporary groups include Asleep at the Wheel and The Hot Club of Cowtown. According to Merle Travis, \"Western swing is nothing more than a group of talented country boys, unschooled in music, but playing the music they feel, beating a solid two-four rhythm to the harmonies that buzz around their brains. When it escapes in all its musical glory, my friend, you have Western swing.\"",

Joan Baez recorded the song for her debut album, Joan Baez, in 1960 and it is her version that is often credited with helping to popularise the song during the 1960s folk revival. The duo Art & Paul also recorded the song in 1960, for their Songs of Earth and Sky album, and Judy Collins included it on her 1961 A Maid of Constant Sorrow album. The Los Angeles folk rock band The Byrds recorded a version of the song that was influenced by Baez's rendition on their 1966 album, Fifth Dimension. Carol Noonan recorded the song for her release \"Carol Noonan - Self Titled\" in 1999 (Carol Noonan Music). The song is derived from Homer's Odyssey, filtered through the 17th century English folk ballad tradition, and tells the story of a prospective suitor who asks a woman if she will marry him. She replies that she cannot because she is betrothed to John Riley, who has gone away over the seas. He persists, asking her whether Riley is worth waiting for and suggesting that he may have drowned, been killed in war, or married another woman. She maintains that she will continue to wait for him, irrespective of his possible fate. In the last stanza, the suitor reveals that he is in fact John Riley, returned from the seas, and has been testing his beloved. The song's theme, that of the \"disguised true lover\", has long been a theme in traditional folk ballads and several variations of this song exist."

      "description": "The Piano Sonata in E major, D 459, is a work for solo piano, composed by Franz Schubert in August 1816. It was first published in 1843, after the composer's death, by Carl August Klemm in Leipzig, in a publication known as Fünf Klavierstücke (Five Piano Pieces). In the first edition of the Deutsch catalogue all five pieces were grouped under the same number 459. Whether it is a single composition in 5 movements is a matter of contention. From the second edition of the Deutsch catalogue the three last pieces of the set were split off as D 459A, Drei Klavierstücke (Three Piano Pieces), with only the two first movements regarded as belonging to the same sonata, D 459. In his introduction to the first edition of the five pieces, Klemm refers to them as compositions, not movements of the same composition. In the extant autograph of the first piece, Allegro moderato, Schubert however wrote Sonate on top of the page, and continues in the same manuscript with an incomplete version of the second piece, the first Scherzo. It is not known whether Klemm possessed another (completer) manuscript of this Scherzo, or is responsible for its completion in its published form. No other combinations of the pieces are known from extant autographs or contemporary copies. Apart from the first two pieces, only a fragmentary draft version of the fifth piece, predating the first printed version, is extant. D 506 has been suggested as a third and final movement of a sonata put together with the third D 459A piece (Allegro patetico) as first and the Adagio D 349 as second movement. Andrea Lindmayr-Brandl follows Klemm in his assertion that he compiled the pieces for his 1843 publication from a number of different Schubert compositions. Lindmayer concludes that the work is \"fragmentary\", because Schubert had broken off the sonata at the close of the development section of the second movement."

      "description": "The Symphony No. 8 by Robert Simpson was completed in 1981 and commissioned by the Royal Philharmonic Society. The first performance was given at the Royal Festival Hall on 10 November 1982 by the Royal Danish Orchestra conducted by Jerzy Semkow. The work employs a large orchestra which includes two sets of timpani and four horns. It one of Simpson’s largest, richest and most complex scores. Prior to composing this work, Simpson had in mind to write a symphony for one particular listener and decided asked a close friend, painter Anthony Dorrell, to describe the kind of symphony he would like to hear. The resulting work was this large-scale four-movement symphony in two halves, each half containing two movements that are played without a break in between each other. The first movement, titled Poco animato, begins with a relatively peaceful, quiet introduction that slowly develops and becomes increasingly agitated throughout the remainder of the movement. It is full of violent, stark and almost feral brass outbursts in the midst of suppressed violence. Just as the first movement reaches its climactic point, it collapses into the second movement, a threateningly sinister Scherzo that gradually builds up to a terrifying, volcanic climax which eventually declines into the depths of the orchestra. After a break, the third movement begins the second half of the work with a passionate Adagio. It opens with a slow fugue, and as the movement progresses the aim of calm and serenity following the horrific first part comes closer to vision. This movement gives way to a vigorous finale, full of the energy that is typical of a Simpson finale. The main subject is derived from the fugue from the third movement, gradually developing to give a sense of harmonic fluidity. The work ends decisively with a biting cadence."

It is in a slow 6/8 or 12/8 time with lilting rhythms, making it somewhat resemble a slow jig or tarantella, and is usually in a minor key. It was used for arias in Baroque operas, and often appears as a movement in instrumental works. Loosely associated with Sicily, the siciliana evokes a pastoral mood, and is often characterized by dotted rhythms that can distinguish it within the broader musical genre of the pastorale."

      "description": "The Great Hymn to the Aten is the longest form of one of a number of hymn-poems written to the creator god Aten and attributed to King Akhenaten who radically changed traditional forms of Egyptian religion replacing them with Atenism. The hymn-poem provides a glimpse of the religious artistry of the Amarna period expressed in multiple forms encompassing literature, new temples, and in the building of a whole new city at the site of present day Amarna as the capital of Egypt. Egyptologist Toby Wilkinson said that \"It has been called 'one of the most significant and splendid pieces of poetry to survive from the pre-Homeric world.'\" Egyptologist John Darnell asserts that the hymn was sung. Various courtiers' rock tombs at Amarna (ancient Akhet-Aten, the city Akhenaten founded) have similar prayers or hymns to the Aten or to the Aten and Akhenaten jointly. One of these, found in almost identical form in five tombs, is known as The Short Hymn to the Aten. The long version discussed in this article was found in the tomb of the courtier (and later Pharaoh) Ay. Akhenaten forbade the worship of other gods, a radical departure from the centuries of Egyptian religious practice. Finally, Akhenaten issued a royal decree that the name Aten was no longer to be depicted by the hieroglyph of a solar disc emanating rays but instead had to be spelled out phonetically. Thus Akhenaten extended even further the heretical belief that Aten was not the disc or orb of the sun (the Egyptian sun god Ra) but a universal spiritual presence (see Akhenaten and Atenism).[citation needed] Akhenaton's religious reforms (later regarded heretical and reverted under his successor Tutankhamun) have been described by some scholars as the earliest known example of monotheistic thought while others consider it to have been an example of henotheism."

It is said to have been invented in the 19th century by a dancer named Faico; others who stylized and expanded farruca included Antonio de Bilbao. Ramirez, Manolito la Rosa, El Batato and Rafaela Valverde, and La Tanguera. Other sources indicate that Farruca originated in Galicia, a region in northern Spain. Although there are female flamenco dancers who exclusively danced farruca too (such as Rafaela Valverde also known as La Tanguera), these female dancers originally danced the farruca wearing male clothing. Farruca is seldom sung. The farruca is commonly played in the key of A minor, with each compás equivalent to 2 measures of 4/4 time with emphasis on the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th beats: [1] 2 [3] 4 [5] 6 [7] 8 The dance often has fast turns, quick intense footwork, held lifts and falls, dramatic poses and bursts of filigrana (often with a flat hand).

      "description": "Schauet doch und sehet, ob irgend ein Schmerz sei (Behold and see, if there be any sorrow), BWV 46, is a church cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach. He composed it in Leipzig for the tenth Sunday after Trinity and first performed it on 1 August 1723. The cantata is part of Bach's first annual cycle of cantatas, which he began when he took up office as Thomaskantor in May 1723. The topic is based on the prescribed reading from the gospel of Luke, Jesus announcing the destruction of Jerusalem and cleansing of the Temple. The librettist is unknown. The cantata is structured in six movements: two choral movements frame a sequence of alternating recitatives and arias. The opening movement is based on a verse from the Book of Lamentations, a lament of the destructed Jerusalem, related to the announcement from the gospel. The text moves from reflecting God's wrath in the past to the situation of the contemporary Christian. The closing chorale, a stanza from Johann Matthäus Meyfart's hymn \"O großer Gott von Macht\", is a prayer culminating in the thought \"do not repay us according to our sins\". The cantata is scored for three vocal soloists (alto, tenor and bass), a four-part choir, a slide trumpet, two recorders, two oboes da caccia, strings and basso continuo. This is an unusually rich instrumentation for an ordinary Sunday. Bach created in the opening chorus an unusual \"uncompromising\" fugue for up to nine parts. The bass aria with an obbligato trumpet, depicting God's wrath compared to a thunderstorm, has been regarded as \"more frightening\" than any contemporary operatic 'rage' arias. The closing chorale is not the usual simple four-part setting, but includes instrumental interludes reminiscent of motifs used before. Bach used music of the first section of the opening chorus for Qui tollis peccata mundi of his Mass in B minor. He made considerable changes when he adapted the lamenting music to depict the Lamb of God carrying the sins of the world."

The cantus firmus, or tenor, \"holds\" the original chant, while the other parts develop complex melismas on the vowels. The various settings of Viderunt Omnes provide context for specific trends in medieval music."

The Italian Concerto has become popular among Bach's keyboard works, and has been widely recorded both on the harpsichord and the piano. Movements: The Italian Concerto's two lively F major outer movements, in ritornello style, frame a florid arioso-style movement in D minor, the relative minor. An Italian concerto relies upon the contrasting roles of different groups of instruments in an ensemble; Bach imitates this effect by creating contrasts using the forte and piano manuals of a two-manual harpsichord throughout the piece. In fact, along with the French Overture and some of the Goldberg Variations, this is one of the few works by Bach which specifically require a 2-manual harpsichord. Bach also transcribed Italian concertos by Vivaldi and others for solo harpsichord (BWV 972–987), and for solo organ or pedal harpsichord (BWV 592–596)."

Sant'Alessio was the first opera to be written on a historical subject. It describes the inner life of fifth-century Saint Alexis. The work broke new ground with a psychological characterization of a type that was new to opera. It also contains interspersed comic scenes that are anachronistically drawn from the contemporary life of Rome in the 17th century."

It was translated into German and then into Russian and became a hymn. It was translated into English from the Russian by English missionary Stuart K. Hine, who also added two original verses of his own. The composition was set to a Russian melody. It was popularised by George Beverly Shea and Cliff Barrows during the Billy Graham crusades. It was voted the United Kingdom's favourite hymn by BBC's Songs of Praise. \"How Great Thou Art\" was ranked second (after \"Amazing Grace\") on a list of the favourite hymns of all time in a survey by Today's Christian magazine in 2001.Notably, all English versions (a Johnny Cash live performance excluded) are in a slow, partly almost reciting manner, totally different from the uptempo style of the Swedish original."

It got its name after Keb Darge's \"Legendary Deep Funk\" DJ night, held at Madame Jojo's nightclub in London's Soho district. The focus of the scene is collecting and DJing rare funk 45s of the deep funk genre, most usually released originally by local funk groups and artists in the USA throughout the 1960s and 70s that usually stayed in their local home bases, only playing nearby clubs and other venues, and releasing their music on small local and regional record labels at the time in the form of 7\" 45 rpm singles in quite small quantities (usually about 1000–5000 copies or fewer), hence their extreme rarity and high collectible value. Most of these records have quite high re-sale values due to their scarcity, with some selling for upwards of four to five figures. The main deep funk DJs still working are Ian Wright, Fryer, Jason Stirland, Funky Plumber and Jazzman Gerald. Deep funk is a reference to the term \"deep soul\" coined by Dave Godin[citation needed].",

Despite being advocated by Joachim and Pablo de Sarasate, the concerto, which differed from its predecessors in its adherence to traditional classical structures never attained the same prominence as the G minor concerto. In recent years the concerto has been described as \"...a musical unicorn: since it has almost never been played, its existence is for many the stuff only of musicological folklore.\" One recent set of program notes for a performance of the G minor concerto even denied the existence of the concerto, stating that Bruch had only composed two violin concertos, the G minor concerto and the D minor concerto composed for Sarasate."

      "description": "Lobet Gott in seinen Reichen (Laud to God in all his kingdoms), BWV 11, known as the Ascension Oratorio (Himmelfahrtsoratorium), is an oratorio by Johann Sebastian Bach, marked by him as Oratorium In Festo Ascensionis Xsti (Oratorio for the feast of the Ascension of Christ), probably composed in 1735 for the service for Ascension and first performed on 19 May 1735. Bach had composed his Christmas Oratorio, based on the gospels of Luke and Matthew, in 1734. He had composed an Easter Oratorio already in 1725. The text for the Ascension Oratorio, a compilation of several biblical sources, free poetry and chorales, was presumably written by Picander who had worked on the libretto for the Christmas Oratorio. It follows the story of the Ascension as told in Luke, Mark and the Acts of the Apostles. The oratorio is structured in eleven movements in two parts, taking about half an hour to perform. It is framed by extended choral movements, Part I is concluded by the fourth stanza of Johann Rist's hymn \"Du Lebensfürst, Herr Jesu Christ\" in a four part setting. The closing chorale on the seventh stanza of Gottfried Wilhelm Sacer's \"Gott fähret auf gen Himmel\" is set as a chorale fantasia. The work is richly scored for the feast day, exactly like the Christmas Oratorio for four vocal parts, three trumpets, timpani, two flauti traversi, two oboes, strings and continuo. While the recitatives and the first chorale were new compositions, Bach based the other choral movements and the two arias on parts of earlier cantatas. He used the model for the alto aria again much later for the Agnus Dei of his Mass in B minor."

He led the first performance it on 26 November 1724, concluding the liturgical year of 1724. The cantata is based upon Jakob Ebert's hymn \"Du Friedefürst, Herr Jesu Christ\". It matches the Sunday's prescribed gospel reading, the Tribulation from the Gospel of Matthew, in a general way. The hymn's first and last stanza are used unchanged in both text and tune: the former is set as a chorale fantasia, the latter as a four-part closing chorale. An unknown librettist paraphrased the inner stanzas as alternating arias and recitatives. Bach scored the cantata for four vocal soloists (soprano, alto, tenor, bass), a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of natural horn, enforcing the soprano in the hymn tune, two oboes d'amore, strings and basso continuo."

      "description": "Outsider music is the term used to describe songs and compositions by musicians who are not part of the commercial music industry who write music that ignores standard musical or lyrical conventions, either because they have no formal training or because they disagree with conventional rules. This type of music, which often lacks typical structure and may incorporate bizarre lyrics and/or melodies, has few outlets; performers or recordings are often promoted by word of mouth or through fan chat sites, usually among communities of music collectors and music connoisseurs. Outsider musicians usually have much \"greater individual control over the final creative\" product either because of a low budget or because of their \"inability or unwillingness to cooperate\" with modifications by a record label or producer. Very few outsider musicians ever attain anything resembling mainstream popularity; the few that do generally are considered novelty acts. This notwithstanding, there is a niche market for outsider music, and such musicians often maintain a cult following. Though Irwin Chusid claims to have coined the term in the mid-1990s, the sociological descriptor \"outsider\" had been used in connection with music cultures prior to Chusid's writings (with jazz as early as 1959, with rock as early as 1979, and in the late 1970s it was a \"favorite epithet\" in contemporary music in Europe).",

Despite its poor initial reception the symphony is now seen as a dynamic representation of the Russian symphonic tradition, with British composer Robert Simpson calling it \"a powerful work in its own right, stemming from Borodin and Tchaikovsky, but convinced, individual, finely constructed, and achieving a genuinely tragic and heroic expression that stands far above the pathos of his later music.\" The premiere, which took place in St. Petersburg on March 28, 1897, was an absolute disaster for reasons which included under-rehearsal and the poor performance of the conductor Alexander Glazunov. Rachmaninoff subsequently suffered a psychological collapse but did not destroy or attempt to disown the score. It was left in Russia when he went into exile in 1917 and subsequently lost. In 1944, after the composer's death, the separate instrumental parts of the symphony were discovered and were used to reconstruct the full score. The symphony's second performance took place at the Moscow Conservatory on October 17, 1945, conducted by Aleksandr Gauk. Following a general reassessment of Rachmaninoff's music, the First Symphony has been performed frequently and recorded several times."

It is generally classified as one of a number of styles of urban music. British hip hop was originally influenced by the dub/toasting introduced to the United Kingdom by Jamaican migrants in the 1960s–70s, who eventually developed uniquely influenced rapping (or speed-toasting) in order to match the rhythm of the ever-increasing pace and aggression of Jamaican-influenced dub in the UK and to describe street/gang violence, similar to that in the US. UK rap, or speed-toasting, has also been heavily influenced by US hip-hop. British hip hop, particularly that originating from London, was commercially superseded by grime, however, after a post-millennium boom period, the genre remains a hotbed of talent. In 2003, The Times described British hip hop's broad ranging approach:",

The importance of the feast inspired many composers to write cantatas for the occasion, some designed to be performed in church services, others for concert or secular celebration. The Christmas story, telling of music of the angels and suggesting music of the shepherds and cradle song, invited musical treatment. The term is called Weihnachtskantate in German, Cantate de Noël in French. Christmas cantatas have been written on texts in several other languages, such as Czech, Italian, Romanian, and Spanish. Christmas cantata can also mean the performance of the music. Many choirs have a tradition of an annual Christmas cantata."

      "description": "Proibidão, which literally translates to \"strongly prohibited\", is a subgenre of funk carioca music originating from the favelas of Rio de Janeiro where it began in the early 1990s as a parallel phenomenon to the growth of drug gangs in the many slums of the city. The drug gangs sponsored DJs and baile funks in the favelas they controlled to spread respect and love for their gang as well as hate to the other gangs. The music that resulted is proibidão. Proibidão is characterized as a raw mix of live funk vocals and Miami bass structures. The explicit lyrics typically promote the gang the MC is affiliated with, crime, drug use, and violence. Like gang members, MCs who speak ill of their allied gang or perform outside of their gang's territory risk the possibility of violence or death. Each drug gang sponsors their own baile funk at their own favela(s), which results in a unique sound that distinguishes each MC, and by extension, each gang. The highly territorial nature of the gangs has made proibidão an extremely localized form of funk in Rio de Janeiro. Moreover, in Brazil, it is against the law to promote crime in song lyrics which makes most proibidão songs illegal to perform or broadcast through radio (hence the name \"proibidão\"). These two factors seldom allow proibidão to be heard beyond the live performances in favela. Proibidão is a raw musical genre that captures the dark side of Brazilian favelas. One particularly powerful gang, the Comando Vermelho (Portuguese for Red Command) has given poor youths free girls, drinks, and entertainment at their dances, hoping to engrain a positive image of drug-dealing and gang membership to Rio youths. In Red Command released CDs, their gang sign, a CV, sits across the label, representing the community and the gang instead of the artists. The Red Command's influence was best shown in 1990, when William Santos de Souza and Duda, the \"Kings of Rio rap\" at the time, released a track entitled, \"Rap do Borel\" shouting out to a gang-controlled favela in Rio. No gang better represents Proibidão than the Commando Vermelho. Other gangs also have renowned songs. For example, the gang Amigos dos Amigos (Portuguese for ‘’Friends of Friends’’) is known for \"A.D.A do Chuck\", featuring MC Cruel. Another Funk emcee, MC Colibri, was very successful with erotic funk, but he has also already made music for the Terceiro Comando Puro Proibidão has some very important implications for the acquisition of social space in Rio. For the gangs and drug lords, it represents a form of musical expression that corresponds to territorial dominance. In effect, when these gangs host their particular bailes, they assert their authority over rival gangs and state law enforcement. Since Proibidão elicits the criminal lifestyle and habitual drug use which characterize its performers, police naturally attempt to stop the bailes and the correlative spread of Proibidão. Thus, when myriad bailes do subsist each week, despite the efforts of state programs like D.R.E (Divisão de Repressão à Entorpecentes or Division of the Repression Against Drugs) to stop them, it is a palpable win for the gangs. In addition to just hosting these bailes, the gangs recruit urban youth and advertise their daily struggle, which makes the favela bailes a crucial social space in which gangs can conduct business.",

Mozart noted this concerto as complete on 22 March 1784 in his catalog, and performed the work later that month. Cliff Eisen has postulated that this performance was on 31 March 1784. The work is orchestrated for solo piano, flute, two oboes, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, timpani and strings. The concerto is in three movements: Simon Keefe has noted contemporary comments from Mozart's era on how the woodwind writing in this concerto showed a \"newly intricate and sophisticated\" character compared to Mozart's prior keyboard concerti. M.S. Cole has noted Mozart's use of meter changes in the coda of the finale, starting at measure 315, from 2/4 to 3/8, and subsequent thematic transformations. Joel Galand has noted that the finale, in rondo/ritornello form, avoids use of a new re-entry theme."

      "description": "New jack swing or swingbeat is a fusion genre spearheaded by Teddy Riley and Bernard Belle that became popular from the late 1980s into the early 1990s. Its influence, along with hip hop, seeped into pop culture and was the definitive sound of the inventive black New York club scene. It fuses the rhythms, samples, and production techniques of hip hop and dance-pop with the urban contemporary sound of R&B. The new jack swing style developed as many previous music styles did, by combining elements of older styles with newer sensibilities. It used R&B style vocals sung over hip hop and dance-pop style influenced instrumentation. The sound of new jack swing comes from the hip hop \"swing\" beats created by drum machine, and hardware samplers, which was popular during the Golden Age of Hip Hop, with contemporary R&B style singing. Merriam-Webster's online dictionary defines new jack swing as \"pop music usually performed by black musicians that combines elements of traditional jazz, electronica, smooth jazz, funk, rap, and rhythm and blues.\" Encyclopædia Britannica calls it the \"most pop-oriented rhythm-and-blues music since 1960s Motown,\" since its \"performers were unabashed entertainers, free of artistic pretensions; its songwriters and producers were commercial professionals.\" New jack swing did not take up the trend of using sampled beats, and instead created beats using the then-new SP-1200 sampler and Roland TR-808 drum machine to lay an \"insistent beat under light melody lines and clearly enunciated vocals.\" Encyclopædia Britannica states that the \"key producers\" were Babyface, Bernard Belle, and Teddy Riley.",

The symphony is his last composition preceding a nine-month stay in hospital (starting September 1970); it is also his longest symphony. There is one movement, though it divides into a number of smaller sections that follow each other with at most nominal pause but usually none. The notes to the cpo recording identify 17 such sections, partially for analysis. Much though not all of the material in the symphony is based on the ascending scale motif heard at the very beginning, played by bassoons, violas and cellos. The concluding bars of the symphony are described by Peter Ruzicka as a Canto whose main theme goes from violins and cellos to violas in unison, and which ends in a slow cadence into F major. Pettersson dedicated the symphony to Sergiu Comissiona and the Gothenburg Symphony, who premiered it on 18 February 1971 and had commissioned it for the 350th Anniversary of the Founding of the City of Gothenburg. The miniature score was published in 1989 by Nordiska Musikforlaget of Stockholm and runs to 385 pages."

A dance and music created by the Garifuna people of present-day St. Vincent and Dominica. The best known traditional dance in Honduras, Belize, Guatemala, and parts of Nicaragua is Punta (called banguity), before the arrival of the Garifuna people in Punta Gorda, Roatan, Honduras on April 12 of 1797. The first album record of traditional punta music was released originally on 1955 in Honduras by Stone record, a Belizean record company. Sambunango made famous by Gatos Bravos of Honduras, released in 1987, it's known as the first commercially produced punta music song from Honduras. The most famous song of punta music is Sopa De Caracol made famous by Banda Blanca, The song was originally written be Belizean singer Hernan \"Chico\" Ramos, and translated into Spanish by Banda Blanca. It's mostly popular in Honduras, where it comes from. Contemporary punta arose in the last thirty years of the twentieth century in Belize, while the earliest notions of the punta dance precede the coming together of the West African tribes and the Amerindian tribes of the Caribbean in the 17th century The diaspora of Garinagu people, commonly called the \"Garifuna Nation\", dates back to their origins of the amalgamation of West African slaves and the Arawak and Carib Amerindians. Punta is used to reaffirm and express the struggle felt by those of the indigenous population's common heritage through cultural art forms, such as dance and music and to highlight their strong sense of endurance. Besides Belize, punta also has a following in Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Southern Mexico and the United States. Lyrics may be in Garifuna, Kriol, English or Spanish. However, most songs are performed in the indigenous Awarak and Carib-based languages of the Garinagu and are often simply contemporary adaptations of traditional Garifuna songs. Being the most popular dance in Garifuna culture, punta can be performed at wakes, holidays, parties, ancestral celebrations, and other social events. Punta is iconic of Garifuna ethnicity and modernity, and can be seen as a poetic folk art that connects older cultures and rhythms with new sound. Chumba and hunguhungu, circular dances in triple rhythm, are often combined with punta.",

      "description": "\"The Minstrel Boy\" is an Irish patriotic song written by Thomas Moore (1779–1852) who set it to the melody of The Moreen, an old Irish air. It is widely believed that Moore composed the song in remembrance of a number of his friends, whom he met while studying at Trinity College, Dublin and who had participated in (and were killed during) the Irish Rebellion of 1798. The song gained widespread popularity and became a favourite of many Irishmen who fought during the American Civil War and gained even more popularity after World War I. The song is notably associated with organisations that historically had a heavy representation of Irish-Americans, in particular the police and fire departments of New York, Boston and Chicago and those of various other major US metropolitan areas, even after those organisations have ceased to have a substantial over-representation of personnel of Irish ancestry. The melody is frequently played at funerals of members and/or officers of such organisations who have died or been killed in service, typically on bagpipes. Unsurprisingly, given its lyrics, it is also associated with the Irish Army and with traditionally Irish regiments in the armies of the United Kingdom and the United States as well as other armies of the world."

He composed it for the first Sunday after Trinity and first performed it in Leipzig on 30 May 1723. The complex work in two parts of seven movements each marks the beginning of his first annual cycle of cantatas. Bach composed the cantata at a decisive turning point in his career. After various positions in churches and courts, he assumed his post of Thomaskantor in Leipzig on the first Sunday after Trinity, performing this cantata. He began the ambitious project of composing a new cantata for every occasion of the liturgical year. The work is structured in an unusual layout of 14 movements in two symmetrical parts, to be performed before and after the sermon. The unknown poet begins his text with a quotation from Psalm 26 and departs from its ideas on wealth and poverty, rich and poor, and illustrates the contrasts. The focus of the second part is on being poor or rich in spirit. Both parts are concluded by a stanza of Samuel Rodigast's hymn \"Was Gott tut, das ist wohlgetan\"."

Schubert abandoned the sonata, and only the first two movements of the sonata were fully completed, with the trio section of the third movement also written in full. The minuet section of the third movement is incomplete and contains unusual harmonic changes, which suggests it was there Schubert had become disillusioned and abandoned the movement and later the sonata. The final fourth movement is also incomplete, ending abruptly after 272 bars. The fragments of the sonata survived in Schubert's manuscripts, and later the work was collected and published in its incomplete form in 1861."

It formed the first half of the programme, followed by a performance of Beethoven's Mass in C and Schubert's Song of Miriam in the second half. Sullivan was musical director of the Leeds Festival in 1880 and conducted the performance. The Martyr of Antioch is based on the 1822 epic poem by Henry Hart Milman (the Dean of St. Paul's) concerning the martyrdom of St. Margaret of Antioch in the 3rd century. The libretto was adapted for the occasion by Sullivan's friend and collaborator, the librettist W. S. Gilbert. Their fifth opera, The Pirates of Penzance, had premiered in London earlier that year. Like many of Sullivan's large-scale choral works, The Martyr is theatrical in conception and was even presented as an opera by the Carl Rosa Opera Company in 1898. At the Leeds Festival of 1886, Sullivan would premiere an even more successful choral work, The Golden Legend. The Martyr is rarely performed today, though two recordings are available. A professional recording was made at the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival in 2000, and an amateur recording was issued by The Sir Arthur Sullivan Society in the 1980s. In addition, various selections from the work have been recorded over the past few decades. During much of the 20th century, Sullivan's serious classical compositions were overshadowed by the Savoy operas, but more recently, revived interest in these works has led to recordings and more frequent performances."

Traditionally performed by poor workers of African descent in streets and solares (courtyards), rumba remains one of Cuba's most characteristic forms of music and dance. Vocal improvisation, elaborate dancing and polyrhythmic drumming are the key components of all rumba styles. Cajones (wooden boxes) were used as drums until the early 20th century, when they were replaced by tumbadoras (conga drums). During the genre's recorded history, which began in the 1940s, there have been numerous successful rumba bands such as Los Papines, Los Muñequitos de Matanzas, Clave y Guaguancó, AfroCuba de Matanzas and Yoruba Andabo. Since its early days, the genre's popularity has been largely confined to Cuba, although its legacy has reached well beyond the island. In the United States it gave its name to the so-called \"ballroom rumba\" or rhumba, and in Africa soukous is commonly referred to as \"Congolese rumba\" (despite being actually based on son cubano). Its influence in Spain is testified by rumba flamenca and derivatives such as Catalan rumba.",

The composer termed the cycle a \"Bühnenfestspiel\" (stage festival play), structured in three days preceded by a Vorabend (\"preliminary evening\"). It is often referred to as the Ring Cycle, Wagner's Ring, or simply The Ring. Wagner wrote the libretto and music over the course of about twenty-six years, from 1848 to 1874. The four parts that constitute the Ring cycle are, in sequence: Although individual works of the sequence have been occasionally performed separately, Wagner intended them to be performed in series. The first performance as a cycle opened the first Bayreuth Festival in 1876, beginning with Das Rheingold on 13 August and ending with Götterdämmerung on 17 August."

The structure and patterns would be based on Indian music with the improvisation typical to jazz overlaid. The term might be comparatively recent, but the concept dates at least to the mid-1950s. Musicians including John Coltrane, Yusef Lateef and others showed Indian influences. The Mahavishnu Orchestra might be an early example of a jazz group with Indian influences as John McLaughlin at that time was a devotee of Sri Chinmoy. Others found the improvisational elements already in some Indian music to fit well with jazz. Although John Mayer and Joe Harriott are perhaps the most important influences in the movement. In addition Alice Coltrane is also known for relational work. In the early 1970s, L. Subramaniam pioneered a new movement of Indo-Jazz fusion, which he called \"Neo-fusion.\" It became very popular especially after the release of his albums such as Fantasy Without Limits (1979), Blossom (1981), Spanish Wave (1983), Conversations (1984), Indian Express (1985), and Mani and Co. (1986), in which he collaborated with musicians including Stephane Grappelli, George Duke, Stanley Clarke, Tony Williams, Herbie Hancock, Larry Coryell, Emil Richards among others. The most popular Indian-based Indo-jazz band would be KARMA, with internationally acclaimed tabla maestro Subhen Chatterjee, Lew Hilt (India's best known bassist), Amyt Dutta (one of India's best jazz guitarists) and others fronting the band.. Indo jazz is danced all around the world and many studios have opened up in honour of it. An example is Shaimak, famous for teaching all kinds of Indian dancing, from traditional to modern. They specialize in Indo Jazz.",

Celtic fusion may or may not include authentic traditional music from any one tradition under the Celtic umbrella, but its common characteristic is the inspiration by Celtic identity. The oldest musical tradition which fits under the label of Celtic fusion originated in the rural American south in the early colonial period and incorporated Scottish, Scots-Irish, Irish, and African American influences. Variously referred to as roots music, American folk music, or old-time music, this tradition has exerted a strong influence on all forms of American music, including country, blues, and rock and roll. The connections between traditional Scottish and Irish music and Rock music are deep and go back to the origins of American music. As Elvis Costello put it: Another manifestation of this syncretic tendency emerged in New York in the 1890s, as bands performing traditional Irish music for the large Irish immigrant community there began incorporating big band influences, adding brass and reed instruments and performing quicksteps, foxtrots, and other popular contemporary dance tunes. More recently, there has been a flowering of several distinct genres of Celtic fusion. These can be roughly broken down as follows:"

Urban blues evolved from classic blues following the Great Migration of black people from the southern United States to the industrial cities of the north, such as Chicago.Chicago blues is based around the sound of the electric guitar and the harmonica, with the harmonica played through a PA system or guitar amplifier. Urban blues started in Chicago and St. Louis, as music created by part-time musicians playing as street musicians, at rent parties, and other events in the black community. For example, bottleneck guitarist Kokomo Arnold was a steelworker and had a moonshine business that was far more profitable than his music. One of the most important early incubators for Chicago blues was the open air-market on Maxwell Street, one of the largest open-air markets in the nation. Residents of the black community would frequent it to buy and sell just about anything. It was a natural location for blues musicians to perform. The standard path for blues musicians was to start out as street musicians and at house parties and eventually make their way to blues clubs. The first blues clubs in Chicago were mostly in predominantly black neighborhoods on the South Side, with a few in the smaller black neighborhoods on the West Side. One of the most famous was Ruby Lee Gatewood's Tavern, known by patrons as \"The Gates\". During the 1930s virtually every big-name artist played there. What drove the blues to international influence was the promotion of record companies such as Paramount Records, RCA Victor, and Columbia Records. Through such record companies Chicago blues became a commercial enterprise. The new style of music eventually reached Europe and the United Kingdom. In the 1960s, young British musicians were highly influenced by Chicago blues resulting in the British blues movement.",

The genre \"rave\", also known as hardcore by early ravers, first appeared amongst the UK \"acid\" movement during the late 1980s at warehouse parties and other underground venues, as well as on UK pirate radio stations. The genre would develop into oldschool hardcore, which lead onto newer forms of rave music such as drum and bass and 2-step, as well as other hardcore techno genres, such as gabber, hardstyle and happy hardcore. The rave scene was associated with illegal club drugs, notably Ecstasy, the nickname for MDMA. The use of illegal drugs and the rave scene's use of secret dance parties set up in empty warehouses and hangars attracted the attention of law enforcement in various countries, and in some countries laws were passed prohibiting certain rave events. In the late 1980s, rave culture began to filter through from English expatriates and disc jockeys who would visit Continental Europe. However, rave culture's major expansion in North America is often credited to Frankie Bones, who after spinning a party in an aircraft hangar in England helped organize some of the earliest known American raves in the 1990s in New York City called \"Storm Raves\" which maintained a consistent core audience. Coinciding at the same time, were the \"NASA\" parties in NYC by DJ Scotto which was featured in the 1995 movie Kids and concert producer P.A.W.N. LASER in Pennsylvania. After this, hundreds of smaller promotional groups sprung up across the East Coast, causing a true \"scene\" to develop.",

Upon the lifting of martial law in Taiwan in 1987, numerous artists began to produce Taiwanese song tracks and entire albums in Taiwanese. Tai-pop, although cultivated in Taiwan, is also popular amongst Hoklo people in Amoy, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia where it is often referred to as Hokkien/Fukienese pop music.",

On August 14, 1902, William Helms (June 5, 1835 – December 13, 1917), a 72-year-old farmer and civil war veteran, was walking along the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway (later the Missouri Pacific Railroad) where it crosses Big River outside of Irondale (Washington County, Missouri), collecting lumber for a barn he intended to build. He saw No. 4 speed northbound over the bridge. Then, hearing a strange noise and following its source, he found what is described as \"an old fashioned telescoping valise.\" The case turned out to contain a baby, whose age was later estimated at approximately five days. Having fallen about 50 feet (15 m), the child was badly bruised, with a pronounced dent in its head. Helms took the child home to his wife, Sarah Jane Knight Helms (July 10, 1850 – April 15, 1925) and they nursed him back to health. The child was named for his foster father, Bill Helms, and \"Gould,\" the owner of the railroad, but also \"Moses,\" because he was taken from the river. The story spread throughout the United States, and gave rise to the folksong. Many women came forward, claiming to be the boy's mother. However, when the child was six years old, the elderly couple formally adopted him. After the death of the elder Helms, William and his mother moved to Salem, Missouri. He attended Braughton's University and Southwest Missouri State Teachers College (now Missouri State University); his education was paid for by the St. Louis Iron Mountain & Southern Railway. He became a printer. On August 5, 1933 he married a woman named \"Sally,\" (September 17, 1904, d. Racine, Wisconsin, September 1987). They had one son, William (died at age 14, according to some sources). They later moved to Texas, where William died January 31, 1953, aged 51. When the corpse was carried by train back to Washington County, it was only the second time William had ridden a train. He was interred at Hopewell, Missouri Cemetery. The funeral got no publicity; Helms did not enjoy his peculiar fame. The Ballad of the Iron Mountain Baby (likely has changed from the original version, written by Rev. J.T. Barton in late 1902 or early 1903, which is said to have had 14 stanzas) (the ballad mistakes certain key details—the number of the train, the names of the principals, etc.)."

Daniel Auber composed another opera on the same subject, Leicester, ou Le chateau de Kenilworth in 1823. This opera was the first of Donizetti's excursions into the Tudor period of English history, and it was followed in 1830 by Anna Bolena, (which was based on the life of Ann Boleyn, the second wife of King Henry VIII), then by Maria Stuarda (named for Mary, Queen of Scots) which appeared in different forms in 1834 and 1835. All represented the interests (even obsessions) of many Italian composers of the era, Donizetti's included, in the character of Elizabeth I, whose life he was to explore further in 1837 in his opera Roberto Devereux (named for a putative lover of Queen Elizabeth I.) The leading female characters of the operas Anna Bolena, Maria Stuarda, and Roberto Devereux are often referred to as the \"Three Donizetti Queens.\" As Elisabetta al castello di Kenilworth the opera received its first performance on 6 July 1829 at the Teatro San Carlo, Naples and, in a revised version at the same house, as Il castello di Kenilworth on 24 June 1830."

      "description": "Utopia, Limited; or, The Flowers of Progress, is a Savoy Opera, with music by Arthur Sullivan and libretto by W. S. Gilbert. It was the second-to-last of Gilbert and Sullivan's fourteen collaborations, premiering on 7 October 1893 for a run of 245 performances. It did not achieve the success of most of their earlier productions. Gilbert's libretto satirises limited liability companies, and particularly the idea that a bankrupt company could leave creditors unpaid without any liability on the part of its owners. It also lampoons the Joint Stock Company Act by imagining the absurd convergence of natural persons (or sovereign nations) with legal commercial entities under the limited companies laws. In addition, it mocks the conceits of the late 19th-century British Empire and several of the nation's beloved institutions. In mocking the adoption by a \"barbaric\" country of the cultural values of an \"advanced\" nation, it takes a tilt at the cultural aspects of imperialism. The libretto was criticised as too long and rambling by some critics and later commentators, and several subplots introduced in Act I are never resolved. Utopia is performed much less frequently than most other Gilbert and Sullivan operas. It can be expensive to produce, requiring a large principal cast and two costumes (\"native\" and \"drawing room\") for most of the performers. The subject-matter and characters, including the specific government offices, are obscure for modern audiences, although its themes of corporatisation of public institutions and scandal in the British Royal family are evergreen. And although it contains some fine music, it perhaps has less than Sullivan's usual quota of unforgettable tunes. Bernard Shaw, however, wrote in his highly favourable October 1893 review of the show in The World, \"I enjoyed the score of Utopia more than that of any of the previous Savoy operas.\""

Around 33 minutes in length, it is unique in his symphonic output for having vocal parts, specifically wordless solos for soprano and baritone in the second movement. The symphony followed Nielsen's tenure as bandmaster at the Royal Danish Opera in Copenhagen. Nielsen himself conducted the premiere of the work, along with the premiere of his Violin Concerto, on February 28, 1912 with Copenhagen's Royal Danish Orchestra. The character designation of the first movement (Allegro espansivo) serves as the symphony's subtitle, but it is not clear what Nielsen meant by 'espansiva'. Composer Robert Simpson wrote that it suggests the \"outward growth of the mind's scope\". Within two months of its premiere the symphony was in the repertoire of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam, and by 1913 it had seen performances in Germany (Stuttgart), Sweden (Stockholm) and in Finland (Helsinki). It did not receive a public performance in the United Kingdom until 1962, under Bryan Fairfax. Nielsen received 5,000 marks for publishing rights (C.F. Kahnt, Leipzig), a sum significantly higher than he usually received from his publishers. It was the first of Nielsen's symphonies to be commercially released on record, with Erik Tuxen conducting the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra."

Musicians and bands John Hartford, New Grass Revival, J.D. Crowe and the New South, The Dillards, Boone Creek, Country Gazette, and the Seldom Scene pioneered innovations in the genre. Some groups began using electric instruments and importing songs from other genres, particularly rock and roll. Progressive bluegrass became popular in the late 1960s and 1970s, but it can be traced back to the banjo and contrabass duets that Earl Scruggs played even in the earliest days of the Foggy Mountain Boys. The four key distinguishing elements of progressive bluegrass are (1) instrumentation, frequently including electric guitars, drums, piano, and more, (2) songs imported or styles imitated from other musical genres like jazz, rock and others, (3) non-traditional chord progressions, (4) lengthy \"jam band\"-style improvisation. However, not all these elements are always present in progressive bluegrass. Progressive bluegrass continues to be performed by bands today. Innovative groups include Béla Fleck and the Flecktones, Nickel Creek, The Accidentals, Yonder Mountain String Band, Free Grass Union, Candlewyck, Trampled By Turtles, Crooked Still, The String Cheese Incident, Punch Brothers, Railroad Earth, Grassland String Band, Leftover Salmon, and the Coal Porters in Europe. Many older newgrass musicians, along with music festivals such as NedFest, DelFest,Tall Pines Bluegrass and Telluride Bluegrass Festival, have been instrumental in cultivating the continued popularity of progressive bluegrass.",

It premiered on 19 July 1970 at the Glyndebourne Festival conducted by Raymond Leppard and directed by Colin Graham. The title comes from the Irish patriotic song of the same name. The opera was composed over a period from 1967 to 1970 while Maw was the artist-in-residence at Trinity College, Cambridge. It was Maw's second opera, and like his first, One Man Show, is a comedy. However, while One Man Show was a farce, The Rising of the Moon is in the genre of romantic comedy with a plot about British soldiers stationed in 19th-century Ireland at the time of the Irish famines. Its premiere at Glyndebourne in 1970 during The Troubles, a period of intense ethno-political conflict in Northern Ireland, was \"felt to be tactless\" by some critics, according to Maw's obituary in The Daily Telegraph. Nevertheless, the opera ran at 90% capacity at Glyndebourne and was revived the following year after Maw had made adjustments to the score. The opera was subsequently performed in Bremen and Graz in 1978 and at the Guildhall School of Music in 1986. It was also revived at the Wexford Opera Festival in 1990."

It is also sung on Maundy Thursday during the procession from the church to the place where the Blessed Sacrament is kept until Good Friday. The last two stanzas (called, separately, Tantum Ergo) are sung at Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament. The hymn expresses the doctrine that the bread and wine are changed into the Body and Blood of Christ during the celebration of the Eucharist. It is often sung in English as the hymn Of the Glorious Body Telling, to the same tune as the Latin. The opening words recall another famous Latin sequence, from which this hymn is derived: Pange Lingua Gloriosi Proelium Certaminis by Venantius Fortunatus."

The genre, which originated in Germany, is massively popular in the trance scene, and is one of the dominant forms of dance music worldwide. Historically it is related to the emergence of psychedelic trance and the two styles influenced each other.[citation needed] Classical music strongly influenced the development of uplifting trance both in the 1990s and at present, with film music also considered influential.",

It gradually evolved into a string ensemble format by the 1960s, led by the gaohu with ruan, qinqin, yangqin, sanxian, yehu, and various woodwind (including houguan or saxophone) and percussion instruments. Formerly, bowed stringed instruments such as the erxian and tiqin were used. Compositions by the noted gaohu player Lü Wencheng (吕文成, 1898-1981) remain particularly popular. Cantonese opera is popular in Pearl River Delta. Musical institutions in Guangdong include the Guangdong International Summer Music Festival. Teochew music and Teochew opera is pupular in Chaoshan. Hakka music is literary and laid-back in tone, and consists entirely of five notes; many folk songs only use three notes."

Styled \"an entirely original musical extravaganza\", it is based on one of Gilbert's Bab Ballads, \"My Dream\". It opened on 21 March 1874 at the Criterion Theatre in London and ran until 17 April, for about 25 performances. This was the first work shown at the newly built Criterion, and it was played together with An American Lady, written and performed by Gilbert's friend, the dramatist and Fun magazine founder, Henry J. Byron. The musical score to Topsyturveydom does not survive, but amateur productions in recent decades have used newly composed scores or performed the work as a non-musical play. Advertisements for the work spelled the title \"Topsy­turveydom\", whereas the license copy of the libretto, filed with the Lord Chamberlain's office, and now held in the British Library, spells it \"Topsy­turvydom\". Topsy­turveydom is set in a quasi-utopia (reminiscent of Gilbert's earlier Happy Arcadia (1872), or even Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels), where things are the opposite of the norm. Party politics is lampooned, much as it would be two decades later in Gilbert and Sullivan's Utopia, Limited. As in that work, the king is a \"detested\" monarch. Gilbert also renews the idea of party politics working in a backwards way in Iolanthe, where the House of Lords is threatened with obsolescence by having its members selected by competitive examination."

The band generally played guitar-based rock music. The movement was short lived and several of the bands involved were later linked with the more commercially successful Britpop, which it immediately preceded, and the NWONW was described by John Harris of The Guardian (one of the journalists who first coined the term) as \"Britpop without the good bits\". The NME played a major part in promoting and covering the genre, and promoted the On event, which featured many of the bands they had labelled NWONW. Record label Fierce Panda's first release, Shagging in the Streets, was a tribute to the scene, featuring S*M*A*S*H, Done Lying Down, These Animal Men, and others. Associated bands have included Elastica, S*M*A*S*H, Menswear, Sleeper, Echobelly, Shed Seven, These Animal Men, and Compulsion. Robert Christgau identified the mid-1990s NWONW movement as the peak of a new wave revival that has continued on and off since, stating \"1994 was the top of a curve we can't be certain we've reached the bottom of\".",

Composed in 1909, it was not premiered until 6 June 1924 in Prague conducted by Alexander Zemlinsky with Marie Gutheil-Schoder as the soprano. The opera takes the unusual form of a monologue for solo soprano accompanied by a large orchestra. In performance, it lasts for about half an hour. It is sometimes paired with Béla Bartók's opera Bluebeard's Castle (1911), as the two works were roughly contemporary and share similar psychological themes. Schoenberg's succinct description of Erwartung was as follows: Philip Friedheim has described Erwartung as Schoenberg's \"only lengthy work in an athematic style\", where no musical material returns once stated over the course of 426 measures. In his analysis of the structure, one indication of the complexity of the music is that the first scene of over 30 bars contains 9 meter changes and 16 tempo changes. Herbert Buchanan has countered this description of the work as \"athematic\", and the general impression of it as \"atonal\", in his own analysis. The musicologist Charles Rosen has said that Erwartung, along with Berg's Wozzeck and Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, is among the \"impregnable\" \"great monuments of modernism.\""

It is said to have originally consisted of 27 stanzas, with each following stanza beginning with the consecutive letter of the alphabet. Surviving manuscripts may be found in a c. 1361 Dublin Troper (a music book for use at Mass) and a 13th or 14th century vellum Sequentiale that may have been connected with the Church of Addle, Yorkshire. Its lyrics also appear in the works of John Audelay (perhaps a priest, he definitely spent the last years of his life at Haughmond Abbey, where he wrote for the monks), in a group of four Marian poems. It appears in Geoffrey Chaucer's Miller's Tale, where the scholar Nicholas sings it in Latin to the accompaniment of his psaltery: For many years, \"Angelus Ad Virginem\" was the first piece of music sung at the annual Bracebridge Dinner, a lavish Christmas feast held at the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park. It was sung as the guests entered the dining room. This piece of music was selected by Ansel Adams in 1929, who was director of the pageant at that time."

The production was directed by Jorge Petraglia and conducted by Bruno Bartoletti. On February 22, 1966, Plácido Domingo had his international breakthrough by singing the title role of this opera at the US premiere of the work by the New York City Opera. Other cast members included Jeannine Crader as Florinda, Spiro Malas as Teudiselo, the king's tutor, and David Clatworthy as Don Julian, Florinda's father. Julius Rudel conducted, and the opera received 9 performances at New York City Opera. A year later, the production was also shown, still with Plácido Domingo, on tour at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles. Ginastera prepared from the opera a concert work for soprano and orchestra, which received its own first performance in October 1964.

The libretto is based on a hugely successful Heimatroman by Wilhelmine von Hillern (1836–1916), Die Geier-Wally, Eine Geschichte aus den Tyroler Alpen (The Vulture Wally: A Story from the Tyrolean Alps). Wally, short for Walburga, is a girl with some heroic attributes. The story is based on an episode in the life of Tyrolean painter Anna Stainer-Knittel whom von Hillern met. She gets her \"Geier\" (vulture) epithet from once stealing a vulture's hatchling from her nest. Von Hillern's piece was originally serialized in Deutsche Rundschau, and was reproduced in English as \"A German Peasant Romance\", in the Cornhill Magazine in July 1875. The opera is best known for its aria \"Ebben? Ne andrò lontana\" (\"Well, then? I'll go far away,\" act 1, sung when Wally decides to leave her home forever). American soprano Wilhelmenia Fernandez sang this aria in Jean-Jacques Beineix's 1981 movie Diva – a performance at the heart of the thriller. Catalani had composed this aria independently as Chanson Groënlandaise in 1878 and later incorporated it into his opera. The opera features a memorable operatic death in which the heroine throws herself into an avalanche. It is seldom performed, partly because of the difficulty of staging this scene, but Wally's principal aria is still sung frequently."

The second movement is a theme with five variations in E-flat major, Schubert's only set of symphonic variations. Although there is some variation in the melody, the primary focus of the variations are on instrumentation and tone color. The first variation features violins and winds. The second variation passes the theme between the low strings and the woodwinds. The third variation is again violins and winds. The fourth variation is in C minor and features some acceleration with the use triplet-sixteenth notes. The fifth variation maintains the triplet-sixteenths, but they move into the background with the melody returning close to its original form as a kind of recapitulation. A coda concludes the movement. The minuet is in C minor and mainly scored for the tutti and fortissimo. The contrasting Trio in E flat major is more thinly scored winds, violins and pizzicato bass. The melody of the trio is actually a variation of the theme used in the second movement forming a melodic and harmonic (E-flat/C minor) link is made between the inner two movements. The finale is a galop in fast 2/4 time."

The libretto is based on the novella The Turn of the Screw by Henry James. The opera was commissioned by the Venice Biennale and given its world premiere on 14 September 1954, at the Teatro La Fenice, Venice. The original recording was made during that year, with the composer conducting. Described as one of the most dramatically appealing English operas, the opera in two acts has a prologue and sixteen scenes, each preceded by a variation on the twelve-note 'Screw' theme. Typically of Britten, the music mixes tonality and dissonance, with Britten's recurrent use of a twelve-tone figure being perhaps a nod to the approach of Arnold Schoenberg. Thematically, the play gives a central role to a line borrowed from W. B. Yeats' poem \"The Second Coming\": \"The ceremony of innocence is drowned.\""

The opera's unifying concept is the idea of the borderlines between emotional, metaphysical and moral states.

The concerto was initially well received and awarded the Stalin Prize for arts in 1941. The work became a staple of the 20th century violin repertoire, and maintains its popularity into the 21st century. French flautist Jean-Pierre Rampal transcribed the piece for flute in 1968, with encouragement from Khachaturian. Rampal's transcription included a different cadenza in the first movement, but Rampal otherwise strove to adhere to Khachaturian's original. The Violin Concerto was the second of three concertos Khachaturian wrote for the individual members of a renowned Soviet piano trio that performed together from 1941 until 1963.

Appalachian folk music was largely Scottish and Irish, with an important influence also being the African American country blues. Parts of Ontario, British Columbia and the Maritime provinces shared a tradition with the Appalachian region, and country music became popular quite quickly in these places. Fiddlers like George Wade and Don Messer helped to popularize the style, beginning in the late 1920s. Wade was not signed until the 1930s, when Victor Records, inspired by the success of Wilf Carter the year before, signed him, Hank Snow and Hank LaRivière. Canadian country as developed by Otto Wilke, Carter, Snow and Earl Heywood, used a less nasal and more distinctly pronounced vocal style than American music, and stuck with more traditional ballads and narratives while American country began to use more songs about bars and lovers' quarrels. This style of country music became very popular in Canada over the next couple of decades. Later popular Canadian country stars range from Stompin' Tom Connors to Shania Twain to Rick Tippe.Radio and television stations in Canada which play country music, however, are often more flexible in how they define the genre than their counterparts in the United States. Canadian country stations frequently play artists more commonly associated with folk music, such as Bruce Cockburn, Leahy and The Rankin Family."

It began as an offshoot of the 1960s California Sound. Sunshine pop is characterized by prominent vocal harmonies and lush orchestrations based on the productions of Phil Spector and the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson. In some ways sunshine pop is similar to baroque pop music through being elaborate and melancholic, though it also crossed into folk pop and Brill Building styles. According to Noel Murray of The A.V. Club, \"influenced by the pretty sounds of easy-listening, the catchiness of commercial jingles, and the chemically induced delirium of the drug scene, the sunshine pop acts expressed an appreciation for the beauty of the world mixed with a sense of anxiety that the good ol’ days were gone for good.\" Sunshine pop enjoyed mainstream success in the latter half of the decade, with many of its top 40 hits peaking in the spring and summer of 1967, especially just before the Summer of Love. Popular bands include the Mamas & the Papas, the Turtles, and the Association. Other acts, like the Millennium, Sagittarius, and the Yellow Balloon were less successful but gained a cult following years later; with albums like Begin (1968) and Present Tense (1968) highly sought-after on the collectors’ market.",

      "description": "Sonata da chiesa (Italian for church sonata) is an instrumental composition dating from the Baroque period, generally consisting of four movements. More than one melody was often used, and the movements were ordered slow–fast–slow–fast with respect to tempo. The second movement was usually a fugal allegro, and the third and fourth were binary forms that sometimes resembled the sarabande and gigue. It is often mistakenly believed these sonatas were composed to be performed in religious ceremonies. In fact, symphonies written in the Sonata da chiesa form were frequently played during Religious ceremonies, especially during the mass \"at the Gradual, Offertory, Elevation and Communion as well as the Introit and Deo Gratias. They were also used as a substitute for antiphons during Vespers. They were not, however, written with an explicitly liturgical function, such as, for instance, a Requiem Mass. Symphonic works written in the sonata da chiesa were more often performed as concert pieces for entertainment. One of the greatest exponents of the sonata da chiesa was the Ravennate Arcangelo Corelli (1653–1713). Among his finest compositions are 6 Sonata da Chiesa, Op.1; dedicated to queen Christina of Sweden, who lived in Rome. The first 8 of his 12 Concerti grossi, op.6 are also sonatas da chiesa. Another composer of this form of music was Giovanni Battista Bassani who c. 1710 composed twelve sonatas da chiesa. The three solo violin sonatas of J. S. Bach are of the sonata da chiesa form, as are the first five of his six sonatas for violin and obbligato harpsichord, BWV 1014–1019. After 1700 this type of sonata tended to merge with the sonata da camera. The sonata da chiesa had become outdated by the time of Joseph Haydn (1732–1809), although he did compose a few of his early symphonies in this style (slow-fast-minuet-fast). Later, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart would compose seventeen \"church sonatas\", but these served a different purpose. Mozart's works were single-movement organ and strings pieces that were played during the celebration of the Mass between the Epistle and the Gospel."

      "description": "L'Histoire du soldat (The Soldier's Tale) is a theatrical work \"to be read, played, and danced\" (\"lue, jouée et dansée\") by three actors and one or several dancers, accompanied by a septet of instruments. The piece was conceived by Igor Stravinsky and Swiss writer C. F. Ramuz based on a Russian folk tale (The Runaway Soldier and the Devil) drawn from the collection of Alexander Afanasyev. The libretto relates the parable of a soldier who trades his fiddle to the devil in return for unlimited economic gain. The music is scored for a septet of violin, double bass, clarinet, bassoon, cornet (often played on trumpet), trombone, and percussion, and the story is told by three actors: the soldier, the devil, and a narrator, who also takes on the roles of minor characters. A dancer plays the non-speaking role of the princess, and there may also be additional ensemble dancers. The original French text by Ramuz has been translated into English by Michael Flanders and Kitty Black, and into German by Hans Reinhart. A full performance of L'Histoire du soldat takes about an hour. The music is rife with changing time signatures. For this reason, it is commonly performed with a conductor, though some ensembles have elected to perform the piece without one. The work was premiered in Lausanne on 28 September 1918, conducted by Ernest Ansermet. The British conductor Edward Clark was a friend and champion of Stravinsky and a former assistant conductor to Ansermet at the Ballets Russes. He conducted the British premiere of L'Histoire du soldat in 1926 in Newcastle upon Tyne, and gave three further fully staged performances in London in July 1927. Stravinsky was assisted greatly in the production of the work by the Swiss philanthropist Werner Reinhart. Reinhart sponsored and largely underwrote the premiere. In gratitude, Stravinsky dedicated the work to Reinhart, and gave him the original manuscript. Reinhart continued his support of Stravinsky’s work in 1919 by funding a series of concerts of his recent chamber music. These included a concert suite of five numbers from The Soldier’s Tale, arranged for clarinet, violin, and piano, which was a nod to Reinhart, who was regarded as an excellent amateur clarinetist. The suite was first performed on 8 November 1919, in Lausanne, long before the better-known suite for the seven original performers became known."

The genre dates from 632 CE, immediately after the death of Muhammad, but the performers address Muhammad as if he were still alive. It is also Sufi genre of belletristic Arab literature. A typical musical performance features a skilled solo maqam singer assisted by a chorus of eight to sixteen men. The chorus sings in unison and a new verse of poetry and prayers or blessings for the audience are added at certain places during the chorus. In North Africa, it resembles ma'luf or andalusi nubah, in Egypt the dur, in Syria the muwashshah, and in Iraq the maqam al-iraqi. Musical genres or subgenres in the madih repertoire include tanzilah (\"revelation\"), ibtihal (\"supplication\"), tawassul (\"beseechment\"), tawshih, and muwashshah. A typical performance includes a solo singer accompanied by a chorus of men with frame drums, the chorus singing a refrain which the soloist improvisationally answers through variation, paraphrasing, or transformation of the refrain, emphasising the characteristics of the respective maqam row or scale."

It was subsequently set by as many as 30 composers, including Niccolò Jommelli (1743), Ignaz Holzbauer (1752), Leopold Kozeluch (1780), Joseph Schuster (1787), Antonio Salieri (1821), and most famously Mozart (1771). The Mozart is the best known, if only because the composer's output receives more examination. Composed in March to July 1771 when Mozart was 15 years old, K. 118 (74c) is a 140-minute \"azione sacra\" on a text by Metastasio tracing the story of Judith and Holofernes from the biblical Book of Judith. It was commissioned in March 1771 by Giuseppe Ximenes, Prince of Aragon, while Mozart and his father Leopold were on the way home to Salzburg from their first journey to Italy. It is the only oratorio Mozart ever wrote. Its two parts comprise sixteen arias, with solo or choral parts, scored for soloists, choir and orchestra. Not performed in Mozart's lifetime, La Betulia liberata is shaped stylistically to works by Leonardo Leo and Johann Adolph Hasse. Both the Mozart and the Jommelli drew attention in 2010 when they were performed side-by-side at the Salzburg Whitsun and Ravenna festivals under the leadership of Riccardo Muti"

The song was written as a duet, with the Pogues' singer MacGowan taking the role of the male character and MacColl the female character. It is an Irish folk-style ballad, and featured on The Pogues' 1988 album If I Should Fall from Grace with God. Originally begun in 1985, the song had a troubled two year development history, undergoing rewrites and aborted attempts at recording, and losing its original female vocalist along the way, before finally being completed in summer 1987. Although the single never reached number one in the UK Singles Chart, being kept at number two on its original release in 1987 by the Pet Shop Boys' cover version of \"Always on My Mind\", it has since proved enduringly popular with both music critics and the public: to date the song has reached the UK top twenty on twelve separate occasions since its original release in 1987, including every year since 2005, and was certified platinum in the UK in 2013. The song has sold 1.18 million copies in the UK as of November 2015. In the UK it is the most-played Christmas song of the 21st century. \"Fairytale of New York\" has been cited as the best Christmas song of all time in various television, radio and magazine related polls in the UK and Ireland."

Brukdown is a Kriol mixture of European harmonies (Accordion), African syncopated rhythms and call-and-response format and lyrical elements from the native peoples of the area. In its modern form, brukdown is rural folk music, associated especially with the logging towns of the Belizean interior. Traditional instruments include the banjo, guitar, drums, dingaling bell, accordion and a donkey's jawbone played by running a stick up and down the teeth, and also a grater. Brukdown remains a rural, rarely recorded genre. This genre of music has primarily African elements, while the only significant European element, is the Accordion.",

As part of the victory parade of the returning troops, the march was performed for the first time in public in Frankfurt (Oder), where Piefke's garrison was based. As Piefke only performed it on important occasions, the march was unknown to a broader public for a long time. In 1909 the manuscript of the almost forgotten tune turned up and was reworked by army-musical inspector Prof. Grawert. Shortly afterwards it was included in the collection of Prussian army marches. Today it is one of the best known German army marches. It is often played by the Bundeswehr at official ceremonies and state visits. It is also a standard tune in many international military bands. In Germany it is often played by non-professional bands due to its popularity. It has also been adopted by units in other armies, for example by the First Squadron, Honourable Artillery Company. The song is often played by marching bands in Northern Ireland. Also, it is played in the Militar Parades of Chile, performed by the Chilean Army. At the end of episode 3 of The World At War, the Fall of France, it is the music that is played over the newsreel footage of the German victory parade down the Champs-Élysées."

The libretto was written by Nicolò Minato, and was later set by both Giovanni Bononcini and George Frideric Handel. Minato's plot outline is loosely based on Book 7 of Herodotus's Histories. The opera, consisting of a prologue and three acts, was first performed at Venice on the 12 January of 1654, at the Teatro SS Giovanni e Paolo. The opera was highly popular in Italy, not least due to Cavalli's setting of \"Ombra mai fù\" (later more famously set by Handel): 9 different revivals were given across Italy while Cavalli lived. In 1660 Cavalli was persuaded to travel to France to produce a new opera for the wedding of Louis XIV in Paris. Unfortunately for the composer, he soon became entangled in court intrigue which ensured that the projected opera, Ercole amante, was not ready in time and had to be replaced by a revival of Xerse at the last minute. Xerse was given with ballets by Cavalli's rival Jean-Baptiste Lully, a Florentine who had become the official court composer in France. The whole spectacle lasted eight or nine hours and the French audience had little appreciation for an opera in a foreign language, preferring Lully's dance music."

The sketch includes the whole slow introduction and the first theme of the Allegro before breaking off. It is one of Schubert's six unfinished symphonies. It was begun in 1811, but it is unclear exactly how much he wrote before he abandoned the symphony (despite the fact that he would live another seventeen years). Its instrumentation is for the standard early Schubertian and classical orchestra, with the addition of trombones. Schubert authority, conductor and composer Brian Newbould suggests that the piece was modelled on Ludwig van Beethoven's second symphony. Despite Beethoven's second not including trombones, Schubert included trombones in this incomplete work. Newbould states that the presence of trombones does not fit well with early Schubert's orchestral style and notes that they \"have nothing special to contribute. Nor is the youngster sure how to notate their part. ... Perhaps he was merely obeying one of those headstrong impulses that impel the young to run before they can walk.\" Nonetheless, the way Schubert uses the trombones in D 2B indicates that he knows what their function is in an orchestra. elative c' { }"

The work uses an English libretto by Arnold Sundgaard (1909–2006) after Ole Edvart Rølvaag's 1924-5 novel of the same name. The idea for the opera was originally conceived by Sundgaard, and depicts a story of tragedy and romance among Norwegian American settlers of Dakota Territory in 1873. The work was premiered on March 28, 1951 at Columbia University's Brander Matthews Theatre by the Columbia Opera Workshop. The Pulitzer jury concluded: \"In no opera by an American is there music of such freshness, beauty, and distinctive character. The music has a life of its own apart from its appositeness to the text... Subject, text, and music avoid the cliché and commonplace and combine for an impression of strength and sincerity.\" Moore's compositional style is highly vocal and features a speech-like, through-composed, \"lack of melodic repetition,\" with a, \"fluidity and natural feel [to] the vocal lines.\" Contrastingly, the lack of character development and liveliness, the almost complete lack of attention grabbing motifs, the length, and the premiere performance have all been criticized. Olin Downes wrote that the opera was mostly, \"recitative of little inherent significance.\" The premiere cast included soprano Brenda Miller Cooper as the central figure Beret, along with Josh Wheeler, Roy Johnson, Vivian Bauer, Sam Bertsche, Helen Dautrich, James Cosenza, Frances Paige, Raymond Sharp, and Edward Black. In 1963 Moore improved the orchestration and depiction of Beret at the request of Carl Fischer Music.

The opening verse as published by the Jubilee Singers in 1872: In the song \"Israel\" represents the African-American slaves while \"Egypt\" and \"Pharaoh\" represent the slavemaster.[citation needed] Going \"down\" to Egypt is derived from the Biblical origin; Moses was up on the mountain of God when God commanded him to go to Egypt (Exodus 3:1-12). Also, the Bible generally recognizes Egypt as being at a lower altitude than Jerusalem and other core areas of Israelite territory; thus, going to Egypt means going \"down\" while going away from Egypt is \"up\". In the context of American slavery, this ancient sense of \"down\" converged with the concept of \"down the river\" (the Mississippi), where slaves' conditions were notoriously worse, a situation which left the idiom \"sell [someone] down the river\" in present-day English."

The work is in four movements: Unlike the sunrise of Le matin, the slow introduction to the opening movement here is a ceremonial march. The first movement begins with a fanfare style, ten bar passage in C major, followed by the allegro part of the movement in D major. The second andante movement begins with an extended \"recitative\" in C major featuring a solo violin. The Andante follows in G major with solo violin and solo cello with prominent obbligato flute parts coloring the accompanying orchestration. The movement ends with an extended cadenza for the solo violin and cello. As is the case with symphonies 6 and 8, the double bass has an extensive solo in the trio of the menuet. Like the previous symphony, the finale contains passages for almost all the instruments, but here its intensified even more with solos and tuttis often exchanging every other bar.

English translations of the song's title include \"In That Place Wholly Faraway\",\"In a Faraway Fairyland\",\"In That Distant Place\",\"In a Land Far Far Away\",and \"In That Far-Off Land\". Wang Luobin wrote the song in 1939 in Qinghai while shooting a film near Qinghai Lake. He met a young Tibetan girl, and wrote a song about the beautiful impression that she left upon him and all those around her. The song is set to the tune of a Kazakh folk song that Wang had collected in the area. It became one of the most popular songs in China and one of the best known Chinese songs in many countries."

      "description": "La liberazione di Ruggiero dall'isola d'Alcina (En. \"The Liberation of Ruggiero from the island of Alcina\") is a comic opera in four scenes by Francesca Caccini, first performed 3 February 1625 at the Villa di Poggio Imperiale in Florence, with a libretto by Ferdinando Saracinelli, based on Ludovico Ariosto's Orlando Furioso. It is the first opera written by a woman, and was long considered to be the first Italian opera to be performed outside of Italy. It was performed to celebrate a visit from Prince Władysław of Poland during Carnival 1625, and it had a revival in Warsaw in 1628. The work was commissioned by Regent Archduchess Maria Maddalena of Austria, wife of Cosimo II de' Medici, for whom Caccini worked. Ruggiero was printed under the protection of Maria Magdalena in 1625, only five years after the first printed opera in Italy. It is the only opera by Francesca Caccini to survive. La liberazione di Ruggiero is written in the stile moderno, that is, the style of Claudio Monteverdi, although the work owes more perhaps to the work of Jacopo Peri. It uses the new stile recitativo, as well as canzonettas in the style of the Concerto delle donne. The scoring of the opera includes the lirone, and somewhat remarkably for the period, does not include a castrato. The scoring of the piece is balanced towards higher voices, with six sopranos, two altos, seven tenors, and only one bass, as well as a trio of recorders. A compositional scheme is used within the work that associates flat keys with the feminine (the female protagonist Alcina and her attendants) and sharp keys with the masculine (the male protagonist Ruggiero and the other male roles). The androgynous (she appears in the form of a man, Atlante) sorceress Melissa is neutral, presented in the key of C major. Alcina is an evil and sexual sorceress, whereas Melissa is androgynous and good. Melissa fights to free Ruggiero from Alcina's spells. Modern critics have interpreted the music as a statement about gender; either that, like Melissa, women must give up their femininity in order to be successful, or that, like Alcina (despite her lack of overt success), women can still be dominant because of the lasting allure of their music. The work has been recorded, and has been revived a number of times, including in Cologne (1983), Ferrara (1987), Stockholm (1990), Minneapolis (1991), Düdingen (Switzerland), Regensburg, Neuburg an der Donau (Germany) (1999) and Brighton Early Music Festival 2015, where it will be recorded on Sunday 8th November by BBC Radio 3."

The only opera by Mascagni with a French libretto, it was an immediate success with both the audience and the critics on its opening night at the Théâtre du Casino in Monte-Carlo on 16 March 1905. Mascagni himself conducted the performance. The opera had its Italian premiere (with an Italian libretto by Mascagni's close collaborator, Giovanni Targioni-Tozzetti) on 13 May 1905 at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome. However, like many of Mascagni's operas apart from Cavalleria rusticana, the work then fell into obscurity. One of its few revivals in modern times was on 4 August 2007 at the Festival della Valle d'Itria, using the original French libretto. (It has been released on CD and DVD. See below.). In October 2008, Opera di Roma used the Italian libretto for a new production of Amica in collaboration with Opéra de Monte-Carlo and the Teatro Carlo Goldoni in Livorno. Set in the mountains of Savoy around 1900, Amica is a classic verismo drama. It recounts a domestic tragedy involving two brothers (Giorgio and Renaldo) and the woman they both love (Amica)."

      "description": "\"A Nation Once Again\" is a song, written in the early to mid-1840s by Thomas Osborne Davis (1814–1845). Davis was a founder of an Irish movement whose aim was the independence of Ireland. Raymond Daly and Derek Warfield describe Davis's acute awareness that songs could have a strong emotional impact on people. Davis wrote that \"a song is worth a thousand harangues\". He felt that music could have a particularly strong influence on Irish people at that time. He wrote: \"Music is the first faculty of the Irish... we will endeavour to teach the people to sing the songs of their country that they may keep alive in their minds the love of the fatherland.\" \"A Nation Once Again\" was first published in The Nation on 13 July 1844 and quickly became a rallying call for the growing Irish nationalist movement at that time. The song is a prime example of the \"Irish rebel music\" subgenre. The song's narrator dreams of a time when Ireland will be, as the title suggests, a free land, with \"our fetters rent in twain\". The lyrics exhort Irishmen to stand up and fight for their land: \"And righteous men must make our land a nation once again\". It has been recorded by many Irish singers and groups, notably John McCormack, The Clancy Brothers, The Dubliners, The Wolfe Tones (a group with Republican leanings) in 1972, the Poxy Boggards, and The Irish Tenors (John McDermott, Ronan Tynan, Anthony Kearns) and Sean Conway for a 2007 single. In the Beatles' movie A Hard Day's Night, Paul McCartney's grandfather begins singing the song at the British police officers after they arrest him for peddling autographed pictures of the band members. In 2002, after an orchestrated e-mail campaign, the Wolfe Tones' 1972 rendition of \"A Nation Once Again\" was voted the world's most popular song according to a BBC World Service global poll of listeners, ahead of \"Vande Mataram\", the national song of India."

Characteristics include common use of hexatonic and heptatonic scales, variety of form, melodic contour, and percussive accompaniment, melodic range averaging between an octave and a twelfth, with rhythmic complexity equal to the Plains Indians musical sub-area. Nettl cites the Kachina dance songs as the most complex songs and the music of Hopi and Zuni as the most complex of the Pueblo, while Tanoan and Keresan music is simpler and intermediate between the Plains and western Pueblos. The music of the Pima and Papago is intermediary between the Plains-Pueblo and the California-Yuman music areas, with melodic movement of the Yuman, though including the rise, and the form and rhythm of the Pueblo. (Nettl 1956, p. 112-113) Work songs are found in Pueblo music, but are otherwise mostly unknown among Native American folk music (Nettl, 1965, p. 152).One well-known melody from the Zuni people is Zuni Sunrise or The Sunrise Call, a song frequently played on Native American flute. This melody was initially collected by Carlos Troyer and published in an arrangement for voice and piano in 1904.Bird impersonation is a major part of the songs. One of the songs goes,Yahahè-ya-ho-a-na le'a-ne ah-o-nye ah-on-yeh Maa-hanu-yeh hanu-yeh hanu-yeh anu-yeh maa-saaha-nye saaha-ye saaha-ye Another goes Maa-hanu-yeh-saaha-pleb-putin"

The libretto was adapted by the composer from the short story Mademoiselle Fifi (1882) by Guy de Maupassant and the dramatized version Mlle Fifi (1896) by Oscar Méténier.The opera was premiered on 4 November 1903 (Old Style) at the Hermitage Theatre by the Moscow Private Opera. During its performing history it was also known under the title Женщина из Руана [Ženščina iz Ruana) = The Woman from Rouen]. The opera was widely performed in Imperial Russia and had special significance during World War I, largely because of its patriotic connotations in the struggle against Germany. Despite this success and an adaptation produced during World War II, this opera seems not to have remained in the standard operatic repertoire afterwards in Russia and not to have been performed in the West. In the music for the opera Cui borrows some French and German tunes, including the tune of the refrain from \"Die Wacht am Rhein\" for the German soldiers."

The most popular reading is that of Hafs on the authority of `asim. Similarly, each melodic passage centers on a single tone level, but the melodic contour and melodic passages are largely shaped by the reading rules, creating passages of different lengths whose temporal expansion is defined through caesuras. Skilled readers may read professionally for mosques in cities. The Qur'an is marked with twenty-six symbols, circles, rectangles, dashes and letters, some in color. These are written above, below, or beside the letters of the alphabet. They indicate the pronunciation of consonants, whether the blending of neighboring or adjacent consonants is allowed, and where recitation pauses and caesuras are forbidden and possible. In this last respect their function is analogous to that of Biblical cantillation marks, but unlike these they do not constitute a word-for-word notation of musical motifs."

New age includes both electronic forms, frequently relying on sustained synth pads or long sequencer-based runs, and acoustic forms, featuring instruments such as flutes, piano, acoustic guitar and a wide variety of non-western acoustic instruments. Vocal arrangements were initially rare in new age, but as it has evolved vocals have become more common, especially vocals featuring Native American-, Sanskrit-, or Tibetan-influenced chants, or lyrics based on mythology such as Celtic legends. New-age music was influenced by a wide range of artists from a variety of genres. Irv Teibel's Environments series (1969–79) featured natural soundscapes, tintinnabulation, and \"Om\" chants and were some of the first publicly available psychoacoustic recordings. In 1973, Mike Oldfield's progressive rock album Tubular Bells became one of the first albums to be referred to under the genre description of new age. Steven Halpern's 1975 Spectrum Suite was a key work that began the new-age music movement. By 1989, there were over 150 small independent record labels releasing new-age music.",

      "description": "Symphony No. 34 in C major, K. 338, was written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in 1780, and completed on 29 August. The work is scored for 2 oboes, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, timpani and strings. elative c { } Although most symphonies have four movements, this symphony has only three, which was still common in the early classical period: The symphony features the fanfares and flourishes typical of the \"festive symphony\" or \"trumpet symphony\", which is characteristic of Austrian symphonic writing in C major. This is the first of Mozart's C-major symphonies to exhibit this character, but the style would be revisited in his subsequent two works in this key, the 36th and 41st symphonies. The first movement is written in sonata form but also contains many styles and formal aspects of an Italian overture. There is no expositional repeat. The expositional coda contains an overture-like crescendo which is not included in the recapitulation. The development is based entirely on new material. The recapitulation on the exposition's first theme is abbreviated and interrupted by a brief development of that theme. Finally, the movement's coda contains nearly all of this first theme creating the appearance of a reverse-recapitulation common in Italian overtures. The second movement in F major is scored for strings sotto voce with divided violas and a single bassoon doubling the cellos and bass. Alfred Einstein advanced a theory in the third edition of the Köchel catalogue that the Minuet K. 409 was written at a later date by the composer for this work. However, there is no proof in the sources to support his thesis. Also, K. 409 calls for two flutes in its orchestration which does not match the rest of the symphony. The finale is in sonata form and features energetic tarantella or saltarello rhythms."

The work was first performed on 12 October 1745 at the Opéra, Paris, and is set to a libretto by Louis de Cahusac. The piece was written to celebrate the French victory at the Battle of Fontenoy in the War of the Austrian Succession. It was revived at the same venue on 21 August 1753. Neither Cuthbert Girdlestone nor Graham Sadler (in the New Penguin Guide) consider this among Rameau's finest works, though both remark on the originality of its overture, which breaks the traditional Lullian mould common to French overtures up to that time."

He was the first person of Indian origin to have a hit rap song played internationally called \"Slumdog Nillionaire.\" Influenced by the writings of the Franco-Mauritian author Khal Torabully, Coolie Mac introduces his predecessor's neologism, \"Coolitude\", into song form. \"Coolitude\" is an intellectual framework designed to articulate the literary imaginaries of mosaic India. Coolitude in itself is an expression from the inner soul of the forgotten Coolie and his descendants only to resurrect the Voice of his Spirit and his community to reverberate the Indian Diasporic experience to the global community. In 1991, the Franco-Guadeloupean singer/songwriter Kooly Robert Jasawant developed an ode for Coolitude. Likewise, Indoribbean Pop is an acoustical framework for \"Coolitude\" to express itself in the soul of music in Coolie Mac's debut album called Cooliology, as well as the literature, poetics, artistry, culture, history and musicality, of the Indian Diasporic community."

The concerto lasts around 70 minutes and is in five movements; in the final movement a male chorus sings words from the final scene of the verse drama Aladdin by Adam Oehlenschläger, who also wrote the words of one of the Danish national anthems. It seems to have been Beethoven who first included a chorus in a concerted work with piano and orchestra, in his Choral Fantasy, Op. 80 of 1808; since then only a handful of works have been scored for similar forces, including Daniel Steibelt's Piano Concerto No. 8 (1st performed March 16, 1820, in Saint Petersburg) and the Piano Concerto No. 6, Op. 192 (1858) by Henri Herz which also have a choral finale. Busoni intended to dedicate the concerto to his friend William Dayas, but he died in 1903. His daughter Karin Dayas gave the first American performance of the concerto in 1932. The first performance of the concerto took place in the Beethoven-Saal, Berlin, Germany on November 10, 1904, at one of Busoni's own concerts of modern music. Busoni was the soloist, with Karl Muck conducting the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra and the Choir of the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church (Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedächtniskirche). The reviews were decidedly mixed, some being filled with outright hostility or derision. The century following its premiere has seen relatively few performances, owing to the large orchestration, complex musical texture, the use of a male chorus, and the staggering demands put on the soloist."

The meter and melody of an irmos is followed by the remaining troparia of the ode; when more than one canon is used (as is typical at matins), only the first canon's irmos is sung, but the irmoi of the subsequent canons must be known in order to determine an ode's melody and so, even in canons where it is known that the irmos is never sung, the irmos is nonetheless specified. Note that in the Russian tradition, often only the irmos is sung, the rest of the ode simply being read; in Greek parishes, often the remaining troparia are simply eliminated, but in non-Russian traditions, all troparia of a canon are sung The term comes from the Greek verb \"to tie, link\" meaning that it poetically connects the Biblical ode to the subject of the canon. Because the irmos presents a rhythmic and melodic pattern for the troparia which follow, \"irmos\" gives its name to the irmologic forms of Byzantine chant. At the end of an ode, the irmos may be repeated, or another irmos may be prescribed to be sung to return to the original biblical theme this is called the katavasia."

It has been popularized by originators like Jaojoby and relative newcomers such as Ninie Doniah, Vaiavy Chila and Dr. J.B. and the Jaguars. The style is funky and energetic, dominated by ringing electric guitars, real or synthesized accordion, and call-and-response polyphonic vocals, propelled by heavy electric bass and a driving percussion section typically including a drum kit, djembe and shakers. The syncopated, polyrhythmic beat of salegy is rapid (typically around 290BPM) and features a distinctive percussion pattern performed on a Western drum kit in 6/8 or 12/4 time with accents on the 3rd or 7th beat. The melody and harmonies are often in the A minor key and feature beautiful high-life electric guitar and synthesized accordion lines. The sound of salegy can be heard at night clubs, cabarets, parties and dance floors across the island. Salegy represents an electrified version of the antsa musical style that was traditionally performed at Betsimisaraka and Tsimihety rituals. In addition to their commonalities in tempo, vocal style, and tendency toward minor keys (which some attribute to an Arab influence, and which stands in contrast to the major key dominance of Highland music), the salegy shares the antsa's structure in that it always features a middle section called the folaka (\"broken\") which is primarily instrumental—voice serves only to urge on more energetic dancing—and during which the vocalists (and the audience) will launch into intricate polyrhythmic hand-clapping to the beat of the music."

The first opera performance was in 1945, with Wang Kun playing the lead role. The film was made in 1950. The first Peking opera performance was in 1958. The first ballet performance was by Shanghai Dance Academy, Shanghai in 1965. It has also been performed by the noted soprano Guo Lanying. The opera is based on legends circulating in the border region of Shanxi, Chahar and Hebei, describing the misery suffered by local peasantry, particularly the misery of the female members. The stories are based on real-life stories of no less than half a dozen women, in a time frame stretching from the late Qing Dynasty to 1920's or 1930's. The political overtone and historical background when it was created means that communist propaganda was added in inevitably, and the most obvious example was the added portion of happy ending and the protagonists joining the communist force, which did not happen in real life. Along with Red Detachment of Women, the ballet is regarded as one of the classics of revolutionary China, and its music is familiar to almost everyone who grew up during the 1960s. It is one of the Eight model plays."

Beethoven did write another finale for it in 1798 for performance in Prague, but that is not the finale that it was published with. It was used by the composer as a vehicle for his own performances as a young virtuoso, initially intended with the Bonn Hofkapelle. It was published in 1801, by which time he had also published the Piano Concerto No. 1 in C major, although it had been composed after this work, in 1796 and 1797. The B-flat major Piano Concerto became an important display piece for the young Beethoven as he sought to establish himself after moving from Bonn to Vienna. He was the soloist at its premiere on 29 March 1795, at Vienna's Burgtheater in a concert marking his public debut. (Prior to that, he had performed only in the private salons of the Viennese nobility.) While the work as a whole is very much in the concerto style of Mozart, there is a sense of drama and contrast that would be present in many of Beethoven's later works. Beethoven himself apparently did not rate this work particularly highly, remarking to the publisher Franz Anton Hoffmeister that, along with the Piano Concerto No. 1, it was \"not one of my best.\" The version that he premiered in 1795 is the version that is performed and recorded today."

Chicago vocal groups tended to feature laid-back sweet harmonies, while solo artists exhibited a highly melodic and somewhat pop approach to their songs. Accompaniment usually featured highly orchestrated arrangements, with horns and strings, by such notable arrangers as Johnny Pate (who largely worked with horns) and Riley Hampton (who specialized in strings).

      "description": "Doom metal is a form of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much \"thicker\" or \"heavier\" sound than other metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal with songs such as \"Black Sabbath\", \"Children of the Grave\", \"Electric Funeral\" and \"Into the Void\". During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble) and Sweden (Candlemass, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre.",

It was printed the same year, the first of his works to be printed. Stylistically it shares features with his other early cantatas. Along with the cantatas BWV 150, 131, 106, 196 and 4 the text of BWV 71 is of a pre-Neumeister character, in other words it does not feature the combination of recitative and arias found in later cantatas.

The Diablada's origins are in the Altiplano region of the Andes mountain range, but its exact birthplace is disputed by scholars. The dance is an important part of the cultural traditions of the cities of Oruro in Bolivia, Puno in Peru, and La Tirana in Chile—it is also not uncommon for the dance to be used as a symbol for these country's indigenous cultural identity.",

Progress was slow, however, in part due to the interruption of the Second World War. The music is primarily for strings alone and is very turbulent and troubled until the trumpet soloist enters near the end of the music, giving this mostly tragic work a hopeful ending. The first performance was given by the Collegium Musicum of Zurich under Sacher on 18 May 1942. The work is in three movements: The work is for string orchestra, except for the addition of a trumpet in the concluding chorale: \"like pulling out an organ stop\", according to the composer. The trumpet part is marked ad libitum, and although occasionally performed by strings alone, most performances include the trumpet. The finale inspired Robert Hall Lewis' concerto for four trumpets. Numerous recordings have been made of the work, including performances conducted by Charles Munch, Serge Baudo, Ernest Ansermet, Herbert von Karajan, Mariss Jansons and Charles Dutoit."

The Cave of the Patriarchs is of unusual interest in that it is a sacred place where Muslims, Jews and Christians pray. The music and a major part of the libretto in the opera is derived directly from, and includes spoken responses from, Israeli, Palestinian and American interviewees who were asked questions about the story of Abraham. The sound track also includes readings from the religious texts that detail the story of Abraham, and a recording of the ambient sound that is found in the ancient building that surrounds the sacred site."

It was popularized by the Royal Navy and the United States Navy in the late 19th century, and variations of it were soon adopted by many branches of the armed services in the United Kingdom and the United States. Services who have adapted the hymn include the Royal Marines, Royal Air Force, the British Army, the United States Coast Guard and the United States Marine Corps, as well as many navies of the British Commonwealth. Accordingly, it is known by many names, variously referred to as the Hymn of Her Majesty's Armed Forces, the Royal Navy Hymn, the United States Navy Hymn (or just The Navy Hymn), and sometimes by the last line of its first verse, \"For Those in Peril on the Sea\". The hymn has a long tradition in civilian maritime contexts as well, being regularly invoked by ship's chaplains and sung during services on ocean crossings."

      "description": "Truck driving country is a subgenre of country and western music. It is characterised by lyrical content about trucks (i.e. commercial vehicles, not pick-up trucks), truck drivers or truckers, and the trucking industry experience. This would include, for example, references to truck stops, CB (Citizen Band) radio, geography, drugs, teamsters, roads, weather, fuel, law enforcement, loads, traffic, ICC (Interstate Commerce Commission), contraband, DOT (Department of Transportation), accidents, et al. In truckmusic, references to “truck” include the following truck types: 10 wheeler, straight truck, 18 wheeler, tractor (bobtail), semi, tractor-trailer, semi tractor trailer, big rig, and some others. It is often confused with road music (e.g. Willie Nelson \"On the Road Again\", Roger Miller \"King of the Road\"), pick-up truck music (e.g. Toby Keith \"Big Old Truck\"), and/or truck driving music. The last category would be the preferred choice of most truck drivers for eclectic listening while driving/operating all types, makes, and styles of trucks. It is, at least partly, an oral history of trucking. A range of social and economic factors in the United States have strongly influenced the evolution of truckmusic as a sub-genera of 'country' music. These factors include wars, civil rights struggles, the demographic shift from rural to urban areas, the feminist movement, economic recessions, changes in the railroads, and the oil embargo. Their impacts have diversified the folklore of truck songs. Technological developments and changes related to both the music business and the trucking industry, however, have brought about the greatest changes to truckmusic. Variously, these include the jukebox, 33⅓ rpm vinyl record albums, 8 track tape, cassette tape, the transistor to digital revolution, the Internet, CB radio, all-night radio broadcasts targeting truckers, Interstate highways, and multiple truck components (sleeper cabs, air suspension, power steering, synchronized transmissions, air conditioning, air seats, and electronics). Collectively, there are more than five hundred truckmusic songs, all of which more or less originate from the oral tradition of truck folklore. Occupations, of course, have traditionally provided the raw material and inspiration for folk music in the United State (e.g. riverboat, mining, Great Lakes water commerce, lumbering, cowboy, agricultural field work and others), influenced by regional culture as well. Folk songs adopt, adapt, and incorporate colloquialisms, slang, and occupational terms into verbal snapshots. In truckmusic, such specialized words and terms as truck rodeo, dog house, twin screw, Georgia overdrive, saddle tanks, jake brake, binder and others borrowed from the lingo of truckers are commonly utilized. CB vocabulary - which is different from truck driver lingo - is used by both truckers and the general public. Some of that vocabulary has evolved into popular culture and subsequently incorporated into truckmusic (e.g. “hammer down,” “shakey town,” “smokey,” and “pedal to the metal”). There has been a certain mystique attached to truck driving and truck drivers, especially those engaged in long distance driving. It is yet to be determined if the enduring image of the truck driver will achieve true folk hero status, even given the past popularity of truckmusic. The post-CB song era perception of “truck drivin'n country” music was that it was a passing fad. At times, the trucker also has been stereotyped as a “sexist, pill-poppin’, burly, pinball playin’, smokey dodgin’, philandering, truck driving son-of-a-gun,” hardly a flattering or positive image. Not surprisingly, many recording artists have not wanted to be associated with truckmusic because of such negativity, and major recording labels have considered truckmusic a novelty of little or lasting commercial value."

It was premiered on 27 January 1947 in Basel by the BKO, conducted by Paul Sacher (, xii; ; , 438). Other sources say it was six days earlier, on the day of the orchestra's twentieth anniversary, 21 January (; , 348), when two other works commissioned by Sacher were also premiered: Arthur Honegger's Symphony No. 4 Deliciae Basiliensis and Bohuslav Martinů's Toccata e due Canzoni (; , 325). The Concerto in D was the first composition Stravinsky created after becoming a naturalised American citizen on 28 December 1945, and was also the first of his works to be published under the contract with his new publisher, Boosey & Hawkes (, 123–25). The concerto has been choreographed several times as a ballet, first by Dore Hoyer at the Hamburg State Opera in 1950. Later ballet versions were made by Jerome Robbins, under the title of The Cage in 1951, and by Werner Ulbrich, as Attis und die Nymphe at the Württembergische Staatstheater, Stuttgart, in 1959 (, 439)."

      "description": "Orango is an unfinished satirical opera sketched in 1932 by Dmitri Shostakovich. The manuscript was found by Olga Digonskaya, a Russian musicologist, in the Glinka Museum, Moscow in 2004. The plan was for a prologue and three acts but only about a quarter, the Prologue, was sketched. The libretto was written by Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy and Alexander Osipovich Starchakov. Since Orango is the protagonist of the opera, half-ape and half-man, one of the sources of inspiration for the libretto was the work of Russian biologist, Ilya Ivanovich Ivanov who attempted hybridization of humans and other primates. According to McBurney, the word suggests orangutan.:38 Shostakovich had visited Ivanov's primate research station in Sukhumi and \"recommended it as a sight worth seeing.\" The Prologue was first performed in an orchestration by Gerard McBurney on 2 December 2011 in Los Angeles, California by the Los Angeles Philharmonic under Esa-Pekka Salonen (conductor) and staged by Peter Sellars (director). The piece was also performed by the Philharmonia Orchestra on 24th August 2015 at the Royal Albert Hall as part of the 2015 BBC Proms, again conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen. Irina Brown was stage director."

      "description": "The Symphony in C major \"No. 52\", K. 208+102, was composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in 1775. The first two movements are from the opera Il re pastore, K. 208, and the last movement, K. 102/213c, was composed separately. The movements are played one after another without a break. elative c { } The symphony is scored for two flutes, two oboes, two horns, two trumpets and strings. The flutes are silent for the third movement. The symphony consists of the following movements: The first movement is the overture of the opera Il re pastore, while the second movement is the first aria from it, Aminta's \"Intendo, amico rio\", with the castrato voice replaced by a solo oboe. Eight additional bars were composed to replace the final bar of the aria, so as to allow the movement to lead directly into the third movement. The second movement is not written out completely, and Mozart may have indicated to a copyist (or added himself in a copy) how to replace the voice with a solo oboe. It was once considered that the March in C, K. 214, might be connected to the final movement, but this hypothesis has been disproven. The Alte Mozart-Ausgabe (published 1879–1882) gives the numbering sequence 1–41 for the 41 numbered symphonies. The unnumbered symphonies (some, including K. 102, published in supplements to the Alte-Mozart Ausgabe until 1910) are sometimes given numbers in the range 42 to 56, even though they were written earlier than Mozart's Symphony No. 41 (written in 1788). The symphony K. 208+102 is given the number 52 in this numbering scheme."

      "description": "Radetzky March, Op. 228, is a march composed by Johann Strauss Sr. in 1848. It was dedicated to the Field Marshal Joseph Radetzky von Radetz and soon became quite popular among regimented marching soldiers. It has been remarked that its tone is more celebratory than martial; Strauss was commissioned to write the piece to commemorate Radetzky's victory at the Battle of Custoza. For the trio, Strauss used an older folk melody called \"Alter Tanz aus Wien“ or \"Tinerl-Lied“ (Tinerl was a popular singer of the day) which was originally in 3/4 time. When Radetzky came back to Vienna after winning the battle of Custoza (1848), his soldiers were singing the then-popular song. Allegedly Strauss heard this singing and incorporated the melody, converted to 2/4 time, into the Radetzky March. When it was first played in front of Austrian officers, they spontaneously clapped and stamped their feet when they heard the chorus. This tradition, with quiet rhythmic clapping on the first iteration of the melody, followed by thunderous clapping on the second, is kept alive today by audience members who know the custom when the march is played in classical music venues in Vienna. The march is almost always played as the last piece at the Neujahrskonzert (New Year's Concert) of the Vienna Philharmonic. The orchestra did not play the Radetzky March on 1 January 2005, because of overwhelming losses due to the devastating tsunami in the Indian Ocean a few days before. The Radetzky March consists of three main parts: Since 1896, this has been the official presentation march of the Chilean Army's Military School of the Liberator Bernardo O'Higgins. The 1st The Queen's Dragoon Guards of the United Kingdom adopted the Radetzky March as its regimental quick march. The Sri Lanka Armoured Corps, whose practices and traditions are based on those of the 1st The Queen's Dragoon Guards, also use the Radetzky March as its regimental quick march."

The symphony is Moore's second essay in that form and is dedicated to the memory of Stephen Vincent Benét, who supplied the libretto for Moore's opera The Devil and Daniel Webster. A work of moderate length and a classical conception inspired by Haydn, it represents Moore's fully formed mature style and is unarguably one of his best pieces. Moore himself described it as: \"an attempt to write in clear, objective, modified classical style, with emphasis on rhythmic and melodic momentum rather than upon sharply contrasted themes or dramatic climaxes\".

The French language libretto by Adolphe d'Ennery and Eugène Cormon is based on Joseph François Souque's Le chevalier de Canolle. The work's premiere was staged by the Opéra-Comique at the Salle Favart theatre on 15 February 1868. The opera is set in Madras at the end of the 18th century, with a mixture of sentimental elegance and precious sensibility amid a picturesque story bearing resemblances to Léo Delibes’s Lakmé: the Indian setting, a military officer – one French, the other English – and a priestess – Djelma, Lakmé. The scenario was proposed to Auber around 1865 by Victorien Sardou, and was first announced for production in September 1866 under another title. The rôle of Hélène was intended as the debut of a brilliant student of Eugénie Garcia, but a court ruling in January 1868 following a case brought by her parents delayed her debut until the following year. In view of this cast change, the role of Hélène was modified. A highpoint of the work is the 'song of the Djinns' for Djelma which became immediately popular, although it was only inserted by the composer at the last minute (possibly a rejected number from Le cheval de bronze of thirty years previously).It was hoped to premiere the piece on 27 January (to celebrate the composer’s birthday) but as there was some orchestration outstanding, it was delayed. Le premier jour de bonheur was at first a good financial success for the Salle Favart, achieving 175 performances before dropping out of the repertoire by the end of the century. Johann Strauss II wrote a quadrille on themes from the opera as his opus 327."

Kaiso music has its origins in West Africa (particularly in present day Nigeria) and in the Kingdom of Kongo and was brought over by the slaves who (in the early history of the art form) used it to sing about their masters. The people would also gather in \"kaiso\" tents where a griot or lead singer would lead them in song. Many early kaisos were sung in French Creole by an individual called a chantwell. Kaiso songs are generally narrative in form and often have a cleverly concealed political subtext. Kaiso performers are known as kaisonians. In Barbados, kaiso refers to a form of stage-presented calypso, such as at the crop over festival.",

In 1891, in a family gathering at the home of Fernando Villalpando, there was a bet between Villapando and Genaro Codina, which consisted of writing a military march. The winner would dedicate the song to the then Governor of the State of Zacatecas, General Jesús Aréchiga. That same year, both the Codina and the Villalpando compositions were submitted to a jury composed of friends and relatives, who gave the victory to the song of Genaro Codina. The original title was \"Marcha Aréchiga\", to be dedicated to the governor Arechiga, but he suggested that the name was changed to March of Zacatecas. The song was premiered in the Hidalgo garden, in the city of Zacatecas, for a serenade of the Municipal Band, directed by Fernando Villalpando, which has the merit of the music; that's where the song earned the title of Himno Regional de Zacatecas (English: Regional Anthem of Zacatecas). Via \"Zacatecas March\" Codina influenced many other composers, including allegations of influence on \"Washington and Lee Swing\" (q.v.)."

This was adapted into the French play Le pasteur, ou L'évangile et le foyer by Émile Souvestre and Eugène Bourgeois. That was in turn translated into Italian by Gaetano Vestri as Stifellius; this formed the basis of Piave's libretto. Verdi's experience in Naples for Luisa Miller had not been a good one and he returned home to Busseto to consider the subject for his next opera. The idea for Stiffelio came from his librettist and, entering into a contract with his publisher, Ricordi, he agreed to proceed, leaving the decision as to the location of the premiere to Ricordi. This became the Teatro Grande (now the Teatro Comunale Giuseppe Verdi) in Trieste and, in spite of difficulties with the censors which resulted in cuts and changes, the opera - Verdi's 16th - was first performed on 16 November 1850."

Traditionally, it is most often associated with the American folk and blues musician Lead Belly, who recorded several versions in the 1940s, as well as the American bluegrass musician Bill Monroe, who helped popularize the song (in a different variant, featuring lyrics about a train) among bluegrass and country audiences with his versions recorded in the 1940s and 1950s. The song, performed by The Four Pennies, reached the UK top twenty in 1964. A live rendering by the American grunge band Nirvana, which reinterpreted Lead Belly's version and was recorded during their MTV Unplugged performance in 1993, helped introduce the song to a new generation."

Enescu had the idea to compose an Oedipus-inspired opera even before finding a libretto and began to sketch music for it in 1910. The first-draft libretto from Fleg arrived in 1913. Enesco completed the music in 1922 and the orchestration in 1931. The opera received its world premiere in Paris on 13 March 1936. The first German production was in Berlin in 1996, in a production that subsequently traveled to the Vienna State Opera. The United States premiere was in 2005 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This dramatic musical treatment of the Oedipus myth is unusual in that it attempts to cover the entire story of Oedipus' life, from birth to death. Act III covers the story of Oedipus the King. Act IV overlaps in plot with Oedipus at Colonus, though with divergent psychological treatment of Oedipus' final days compared to the original. It is generally considered to be Enescu's masterpiece."

Hindemith considered commissioning author Gottfried Benn to write the libretto, but wound up doing it himself. Hindemith completed the opera in 1935. By that time, however, the rise of Nazism prevented Hindemith from securing a performance in Germany, despite three years' efforts.[full citation needed] The story, set during the German Peasants' War (1524-25), concerns Matthias's struggle for artistic freedom of expression in the repressive climate of his day, which mirrored Hindemith's own struggle as the Nazis attained power and repressed dissent.

Goran Bregović was a renowned songwriter and brought his band, Bijelo Dugme, to popular acclaim across Central Europe. Psychedelic rock was taken control of by the pioneers of Bosnian rock Indexi. Punk rock entered Bosnia from Slovenia, and it set roots in Sarajevo, Tuzla, Zenica and Bihać. Rock music was most dominant in Bosnia and Herzegovina out of all the states in Yugoslavia.

Its European premiere was in London on April 17, 2010, with McDuffie and the London Philharmonic Orchestra under conductor Marin Alsop. Glass composed the work in the summer and autumn of 2009 after several years of exchanges between him and McDuffie with the idea of creating a piece that would serve as a companion to Vivaldi's The Four Seasons. When the work was presented to McDuffie, it emerged that his interpretation of the seasons was somewhat different from Glass'. For this reason, Glass presents this as an opportunity for the listener to make his/her own interpretation. The titles of the movements therefore offer no clues as to where Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter might fall, with the composer welcoming other interpretations. Instead of the cadenza typically found in most violin concertos, Glass provided a number of solo pieces for the violinist which act as a prelude to the first movement, and three 'songs' that precede each of the following three movements. Glass also anticipated that these could be played together as separate concert music when abstracted from the whole work. This concerto is now in the repertoire of the Kremerata Baltica and was played for the first time in San José, Costa Rica with Gidon Kremer as soloist in August, 2013."

The Benedictus was the song of thanksgiving uttered by Zechariah on the occasion of the circumcision of his son, John the Baptist. The canticle received its name from its first words in Latin (Benedictus Dominus Deus Israel, “Blessed be the Lord God of Israel”). The whole canticle naturally falls into two parts. The first (verses 68-75) is a song of thanksgiving for the realization of the Messianic hopes of the Jewish nation; but to such realization is given a characteristically Christian tone. As of old, in the family of David, there was power to defend the nation against their enemies, now again that of which they had been so long deprived, and for which they had been yearning, was to be restored to them, but in a higher and spiritual sense. The horn is a sign of power, and the \"horn of salvation\" signified the power of delivering or \"a mighty deliverance\". While the Jews had impatiently borne the yoke of the Romans, they had continually sighed for the time when the House of David was to be their deliverer. The deliverance was now at hand, and was pointed to by Zechariah as the fulfilment of God's oath to Abraham; but the fulfilment is described as a deliverance not for the sake of worldly power, but that \"we may serve him without fear, in holiness and justice all our days\". The second part of the canticle is an address by Zechariah to his own son, who was to take so important a part in the scheme of the Redemption; for he was to be a prophet, and to preach the remission of sins before the coming or the Dawn from on high. The prophecy that he was to \"go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways\" (v. 76) was of course an allusion to the well-known words of Isaiah 40:3 which John himself afterwards applied to his own mission (John 1:23), and which all three Synoptic Gospels adopt (Matt 3:3; Mark 1:2; Luke 3:4). In the Roman Catholic Church, the Benedictus is part of Lauds, probably because of the song of thanksgiving for the coming of the Redeemer in the first part of the canticle. It is believed to have been first introduced by Benedict of Nursia. According to Durandus, the allusion to Christ's coming under the figure of the rising sun had also some influence on its adoption. It also features in various other liturgical offices, notably at a funeral, at the moment of interment, when words of thanksgiving for the Redemption are specially in place as an expression of Christian hope. It is one of the canticles in the Anglican service of Morning Prayer (or Matins) according to the Book of Common Prayer, where it is sung or said after the second (New Testament) lesson, unless Psalm 100 (\"Jubilate Deo\") is used instead. It may also be used as a canticle in the Lutheran service of Matins."

It was premiered on December 1, 1944, in Symphony Hall, Boston, by the Boston Symphony Orchestra conducted by Serge Koussevitzky. It was a great success and has been regularly performed since. It is perhaps the best-known of a number of pieces that have the apparently contradictory title Concerto for Orchestra. This is in contrast to the conventional concerto form, which features a solo instrument with orchestral accompaniment. Bartók said that he called the piece a concerto rather than a symphony because of the way each section of instruments is treated in a soloistic and virtuosic way."

      "description": "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart began his series of preserved piano concertos with four that he wrote at the age of 11, in Salzburg: K. 37 and 39-41. The autographs, all held by the Jagiellonian Library, Kraków, are dated by his father as having been completed in April (K. 37) and July (K. 39-41) of 1767. Although these works were long considered to be original, they are now known to be orchestrations of sonatas by various German virtuosi. The works on which the concertos are based were largely published in Paris, and presumably Mozart and his family became acquainted with them or their composers during their visit to Paris in 1763–64. By using movements from the sonatas of other composers, the young Mozart seems to have begun to learn how to cope with the structural problems of composing in the piano concerto form. Indeed, it may be that Leopold Mozart had devised this as a compositional teaching method. If so, it seems that this may have been the first time this had been done by the composer. This is perhaps supported by two facts: First, Leopold excluded the first four concertos from his 1768 list, suggesting that he may not have considered them true compositions by his son. Second, the autographs of the four works are the joint products of both Mozart and Leopold (although K. 41 is mainly in Leopold's hand alone)."

Chopin composed four sonatas, the others being piano sonatas. The cello sonata was the last of Chopin's works to be published in his lifetime. It is written in four movements: The sonata was written for and dedicated to Auguste Franchomme. The sonata is remarkable for the concentration of its material: much of the music of the first movement grows out of the cello’s opening statement, and certain theme-shapes appear in all its movements. The last three movements were first publicly performed by Franchomme and Chopin at the composer's last public concert, at the Salle Pleyel on 16 February 1848."

Most tracks in this vein feature steady 4/4 beats with a tempo range of 110–130 beats per minute.

      "description": "\"Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing\" is a Christian hymn written by the 18th century pastor and hymnist Robert Robinson. Robert Robinson penned the words at age 22 in the year 1757. In the United States, the hymn is usually set to an American folk tune known as \"Nettleton\", composed by printer John Wyeth, or possibly by Asahel Nettleton. In the United Kingdom, the hymn is also often set to the tune \"Normandy\" by C Bost. The \"Nettleton\" tune is used extensively in partial or full quotation by the American composer Charles Ives, in such works as the First String Quartet and the piano quintet and song \"The Innate\". The \"Nettleton\" tune is also quoted at the end of \"My Trundle Bed\" by Tullius C. O'Kane. A shape note song called \"Warrenton\" also has been sung with a chorus being in 4/4 time or 2/2 cut time; to fit the text to this melody, the second half of each verse is omitted and replaced with a refrain of \"I am bound for the kingdom, will you come to glory with me? / Hallelujah, praise the Lord!\" It has also been covered by the David Crowder Band on their 1999 album All I Can Say. Christian rock band Jars of Clay has also covered the song, as well as veteran Christian artist Scott Wesley Brown. Sufjan Stevens recorded a version for his Hark! Songs for Christmas album, which reached 122 in the US charts and is featured in the closing minutes of the season four premiere episode of Friday Night Lights. Gateway Worship performed the song on their album Living for You and added a chorus to the song, calling it \"Come Thou Fount, Come Thou King\". It also appears on Phil Wickham's album 'sing-a-long'. This song is also sung by Clark Davis in the film Love Comes Softly and is a recurring background music in the film. Mumford & Sons have covered it in a small amount of their live shows. Additionally, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir recorded this hymn as part of their album titled The Sound of Glory. Christian punk pop band Eleventyseven covered the hymn in their Good Spells EP. Gospel recording artist Anthony Brown and group therAPy covered the first verse of the hymn in the song \"Without You\" on their sophomore album Everyday Jesus. The lyrics, which dwell on the theme of divine grace, are based on 1 Samuel 7:12, in which the prophet Samuel raises a stone as a monument, saying, \"Hitherto hath the Lord helped us\" (KJV). The English transliteration of the name Samuel gives to the stone is Ebenezer, meaning Stone of Help. The unusual word Ebenezer commonly appears in hymnal presentations of the lyrics."

      "description": "A double bass concerto is a musical composition, usually in three parts or movements (see concerto), for solo double bass with an orchestra. Many of the first concerti for solo bass were written in the late classical period by Domenico Dragonetti and Johannes Matthias Sperger. Several concerti were also written by Johann Baptist Wanhal, Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf, and Joseph Haydn, although Haydn's has since been lost. Giovanni Bottesini made enormous contributions to the solo double bass repertoire, and among his many works are two virtuostic concerti for double bass and orchestra. In the 20th century, many composers created new works for the instrument, including Serge Koussevitsky, Eduard Tubin, Hans Werner Henze, and John Harbison. The double bass has not been a popular choice for a solo instrument, mainly due to the difficulties of balancing the soloist and orchestra so that the former is not overshadowed. The low register of the double bass makes it difficult to project; to help resolve this problem, many composers (most notably Bottesini) wrote solo parts in the high register of the instrument. Few major composers of the classical and romantic eras were disposed to writing double bass concerti, as there were few instrumentalists capable of taking on the demands of playing as a soloist; it was only through the efforts of virtuosi like Dragonetti, Bottesini, Koussevitsky, and Karr that the double bass began to be recognized as a solo instrument. As the twentieth century began, the standard of double bass technique improved by a significant degree, making it a more popular choice for composers."

In the case of some of Bach's missing scores, we still have the text, but in the case of BWV 248a the text is now lost. Little therefore can be said about the work, even its title is unsure. Its existence can be deduced as some of the music was borrowed for the Christmas Oratorio BWV 248 (written for the Christmas season of 1734). The section in question of the Christmas Oratorio (that for the Feast of the Epiphany) has festive scoring with trumpets and timpani.Some sources describe BWV 248a as a lost church cantata (which would fit with other known parody sources for the oratorio), but there has been speculation that Bach may have written the work to honour a Saxon royal, possibly to welcome the new elector to Leipzig."

      "description": "Indie pop is a subgenre of alternative rock that originated in the United Kingdom in the mid-1980s, with its roots in Scottish post-punk bands on the Postcard Records label in the early 1980s (Josef K and Orange Juice) and the dominant UK independent band of the mid-1980s, the Smiths. Indie pop was inspired by punk's DIY ethic and related ideologies, and it generated a thriving fanzine, label, and club and gig circuit. Indie pop differs from indie rock to the extent that it is more melodic, less abrasive, and relatively angst-free. The term \"indie\" had been used for some time to describe artists on independent labels (and the labels themselves), but the key moment in the naming of \"indie pop\" as a genre was the release of NME's C86 tape in 1986. The compilation featured, among other artists, Primal Scream, the Pastels, and the Wedding Present, and \"indie\" quickly became shorthand for a genre whose defining conventions were identified as jangling guitars, a love of '60s pop, and melodic power pop song structures (the genre was initially dubbed \"C86\" after the tape itself). In the mid to late '80s, indie pop was criticized for its associations with so-called \"shambling\" (a John Peel-coined description celebrating the self-conscious primitive approach of some of the music) and underachievement, but the C86 indie pop scene is now recognized as a pivotal moment for independent music in the UK, as is recognized in the subtitle of that compilation's 2006 extended reissue: CD86: 48 Tracks from the Birth of Indie Pop. Indie pop continues to have a strong following and inspire musicians, not just in the UK, but around the world, with new bands, labels and clubs devoted to the sound.",

      "description": "The word hyphy (/ˈhaɪfiː/ HY-fee) is Oakland slang meaning \"hyperactive.\" More specifically it is an adjective that describes the music and the urban culture associated with that area. It was created by Oakland-based rapper Keak da Sneak when he used the term on an album he recorded in 1994. The hyphy culture began to emerge in the late 1990s and early 2000s as a response from Bay Area rappers against commercial hip hop for not acknowledging their region for setting trends in the hip hop industry. It is distinguished by gritty, pounding rhythms, and in this sense can be associated with San Francisco Bay as crunk music is to the Southern United States. An individual is said to \"get hyphy\" when they dance in an overstated, fast-paced and ridiculous manner, or if they get overloud with other people. The phrase \"to get hyphy\" is similar to the southern phrase \"to get crunk\". Those who consider themselves part of the hyphy movement strive for this behavior. Although the \"hyphy movement\" has just recently[when?] seen light in mainstream America, it has been a long-standing and ever evolving culture in the Bay Area since the early 1990s. Throughout the Bay Area (particularly in East Oakland), there are regularly events called \"sideshows\", where different people come together and partake in or watch illegal automobile performances. This is where drivers do things such as donuts, ghost-riding and street race while others dance and \"go dumb\" around them. These events can be very dangerous. From a USA Today article: \"Every record label was getting at us at that time, but we fumbled the ball,\" says E-40, whose My Ghetto Report Card entered the Billboard album chart at No. 3 in March. \"I hung on like a hubcap in the fast lane along with a few other rappers, and now it's time again. We had a 10-year drought and they went to other regions and were bypassing us like the sand out here. But we're trendsetters, and the rap game without the Bay Area is like old folks without bingo.\"",

Whilst the genre emerged towards the late-1980s, it was not until the 1990s that progressive metal achieved commercial success. Dream Theater, Queensrÿche, Tool and Fates Warning are a few examples of progressive metal bands who achieved commercial success; additionally, Heavy metal bands such as Megadeth incorporated elements of progressive music in their work. Progressive metal's popularity started to decline towards the end of the 1990s, but it remains a largely underground genre with a committed fan base.",

It gained fame during World War II as an inspiration to defend one's land from the enemy. The song combines elements of the heroic, upbeat battle song and of a peasant song depicting a girl longing for her absent love. Standing on a high riverbank, a young woman, Katyusha, sings of her beloved (compared to \"a gray eagle of the steppes\"), who is a soldier serving on the border far away. The theme of the song is that the soldier will protect the Motherland and its people while his girl will preserve their love. While the song is joyful and filled with the imagery of a fertile, blooming land, it also conveys the sense that the motherland is under threat. \"Katyusha\" was first sung by female students from a Russian industrial school in Moscow to bid farewell to Russian soldiers going on the battle front against Nazi Germany in July 1941. It quickly became popular throughout the USSR. Its first official performance was by Valentina Batishcheva in the Column Hall of Moscow's House of the Unions. Later it was performed by Lidiya Ruslanova, Georgi Vinogradov, Eduard Khil, Anna German, Ivan Rebroff, Dmitri Hvorostovsky, Iosif Kobzon, countertenor Vitas, and other singers. \"Katyusha\" is part of the repertoire of the Alexandrov Ensemble.[citation needed] Katyusha is a diminutive form of the female name Ekaterina (Katherine). The song is the probable source of the nickname of the BM-8, BM-13, and BM-31 \"Katyusha\" rocket launchers that were used by the Red Army in World War II."

Hymnologists, such as Erik Routley, may study the history and origins of hymns and of traditions of sung worship, the biographies of the women and men who have written hymns that have passed into choral or congregational use, the interrelationships between text and tune, the historical processes, both folk and redactional, that have changed hymn texts and hymn tunes over time, and the sociopolitical, theological and aesthetic arguments concerning various styles of sung worship. Hymnology is sometimes more strictly construed, as in A Dictionary of Hymnology, edited by John D. Julian, which concerns itself very largely with the history, textual changes, and translations of hymns, and with the biographies of hymnographers, and very little with the poetic metres of these hymns, or with the hymn tunes to which these are sung."

The song appeared on the album 'Back to the Centre', and features Kenny Craddiock on piano. The only other instrument is a guitar solo by Phil Palmer The album was produced by long time Brady collaborator Ian Maidman (later known as Jennifer Maidman). The start of the song compares the tragic events of the Lebanese Civil War with the Troubles in Northern Ireland in the 1980s. Comments are made on activities in Northern Ireland:\"They're rising banners over by the markets /Whitewashing slogans on the shipyard wall\".\"The Markets\" is a well known Republican area surrounding St George's Market in Belfast, and the shipyard is that of Harland and Wolff in East Belfast, near a Loyalist area. The song then compares the peace and serenity of making love on the island with the hypocrisy of some religious leaders and the tragedy of young people being \"sacrificed\" (on both sides) for political beliefs. Some claim it was written as a condemnation of the 1987 Remembrance Day Massacre. This is impossible, of course, as at the time of its recording, the bombings were not to take place for another two years. There are elements of the song, however, which could be construed as Anti-Terrorism."

He composed it in Weimar for the twenty-third Sunday after Trinity and first performed it on 24 November 1715. This work was part of Bach's sequence of composing monthly church cantatas for the Weimar court, which he began in 1714. It was the first piece performed after a mourning period of several months for Prince Johann Ernst. The text, written by the court poet Salomon Franck, is based on the prescribed gospel reading for the Sunday, \"Render unto Caesar...\", and includes several allusions to money and gold. The cantata has six movements, beginning with an aria for tenor, followed by two pairs of recitatives and arias, one for bass and the other for the duet of soprano and alto, and a concluding chorale. Similar to other cantatas on words by Franck, the work is scored for a small Baroque chamber ensemble of two violins, viola, two cellos and continuo. Bach composed a unique aria with a dark texture of a bass voice and two obbligato cellos. A duet has been described as a love duet and compared to operatic duets. The music of the closing chorale is lost, except for the continuo part. It is not clear if Bach set the stanza printed in the libretto from Heermann's \"Wo soll ich fliehen hin\", or instead his \"Meinen Jesum lass ich nicht\", in a tune that appears as a cantus firmus in movement 5."

Such traditions of Vedic chant are often considered the oldest unbroken oral tradition in existence, the fixation of the Vedic texts (samhitas) as preserved dating to roughly the time of Homer (early Iron Age). UNESCO proclaimed the tradition of Vedic chant a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity on November 7, 2003. Wayne Howard noted in the preface of his book, Veda Recitation in Varanasi, \"The four Vedas (Rig, Yajur, Sama and Atharva) are not 'books' in the usual sense, though within the past hundred years each veda has appeared in several printed editions. They are comprised rather of tonally accented verses and hypnotic, abstruse melodies whose proper realizations demand oral instead of visual transmission. They are robbed of their essence when transferred to paper, for without the human element the innumerable nuances and fine intonations – inseparable and necessary components of all four compilations – are lost completely. The ultimate authority in Vedic matters is never the printed page but rather the few members … who are today keeping the centuries-old traditions alive.\""

The government of Solomon Islands describes it as \"the national song of not only Solomon Islands, but also of Melanesia\" as a whole. The song was composed in the 1950s, in the Pijin language of Solomon Islands, by Edwin Nanau Sitori, Rone Naqu and Jason Que. Subsequently recorded and aired by the Solomon Islands Broadcasting Service, it \"immediately became popular\"; its popularity was increased when it was recorded by Solomon Dakei, and sung to Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh during the Duke's visit to the country in 1958. It then \"became an international hit when Fiji’s most famous entertainer and musician [...] Sakiusa Bulicokocoko transformed it from a laid-back island country tune to a rock-and-roll number\". It can now \"be heard all across the Pacific Islands region\", and is considered \"a classic in the Pacific\". It was notably sung in 2010 by Victor Ngele, Solomon Islands Ambassador to the Republic of China (Taiwan), at the conclusion of the Taiwan Study Camp for Future Leaders from Pacific Allies in Taipei. The song refers to the Chinatown in Honiara, the capital city of Solomon Islands. After the Second World War, at a time when Honiara was barely a small town, young men would -according to the song- cross Honiara's Chinatown on their way to hospital staff's accommodation on the far end of the town, hoping to meet nurses there. Thus the song \"is about romance sought, won, lost or just wished\". The song and its title have, at times, inspired academic works, such as M. Bellam's \"Walkabout long Chinatown: Aspects of urban and regional development in the British Solomon Islands\" (1969), or Clive Moore's \"No More Walkabout Long Chinatown: Asian Involvement in the Solomon Islands' Economic and Political Processes\" (2007)."

Nazi punk music generally sounds like other forms of punk rock, but differs by having lyrics that express hatred of some people of color, Jews, homosexuals, communists, anarchists, anti-racists and other perceived enemies. It is a subgenre of punk that contrasts sharply with the anti-authoritarian, anti-fascist, left-wing ideas prevalent in much of the punk subculture. Early punks such as Sid Vicious and Siouxsie Sioux, incorporated Nazi imagery such as Swastikas. In 1978 in Britain, the white nationalist National Front had a punk-oriented youth organization called the Punk Front. Although the Punk Front only lasted one year, it recruited several English punks, as well as forming a number of white power punk bands such as The Dentists, The Ventz, Tragic Minds and White Boss. In the early 1980s, the white power skinhead band Brutal Attack temporarily transformed into a Nazi punk band. They said they did that in the hopes of getting public concerts booked easier, but this tactic did not work, and they soon returned to being a racist skinhead band.[citation needed] The Nazi punk subculture appeared in the United States by the early 1980s, as a direct result of the rise of the hardcore punk scene.",

The authorship of the libretto has been subject to debate; Mondonville's contemporaries ascribed the prologue to Antoine Houdar de la Motte and the three acts of the opera to the Abbé de la Marre. Titon et l'Aurore belongs to the genre known as the pastorale héroïque. The work played an important role in the so-called Querelle des Bouffons, a dispute over the relative merits of the French and Italian operatic traditions which dominated the intellectual life of Paris in the early 1750s. The tremendous success of Mondonville's opera at its premiere was an important victory for the French camp (although their Italian rivals claimed that this was because they had been excluded from their seats by members of the army). Titon was one of Mondonville's most popular works and went on to enjoy several revivals during his lifetime."

Nueva canción is widely recognized to have played a powerful role in the social upheavals in Portugal, Spain and Latin America during the 1970s and 1980s. Nueva canción first surfaced during the 1960s as \"The Chilean New Song\" in Chile. The musical style emerged shortly afterwards in Spain and other areas of Latin America where it came to be known under similar names. Nueva canción renewed traditional Latin American folk music, and was soon associated with revolutionary movements, the Latin American New Left, Liberation Theology, hippie and human rights movements due to political lyrics. It would gain great popularity throughout Latin America, and left an imprint on several other genres like Ibero-American rock, Cumbia and Andean music. Nueva canción musicians often faced censorship, exile, forceful disappearances and even torture by right-wing military dictatorships, as in Francoist Spain, Pinochet's Chile and in Videla and Galtieri's Argentina. Due to nueva canción songs' strongly political messages, some of them have been used in recent political campaigns, the Orange Revolution, which used Violeta Parra's \"Gracias a la Vida\". Nueva canción has become part of the Latin American and Iberian musical canon but is no longer a mainstream genre, and has given way to other genres, particularly Rock en español.",

The segaba is more like a violin, in the design, but uses only one string hooked to a tin. The setinkane is made with varying forks, and played more like a keyboard. During the colonial era, Tswana folk music was discouraged because it was considered a hindrance in the proper development of the region and people. Since independence for Botswana, folk music has been revived, though still the most popular music is from elsewhere in Africa (especially South Africa), United States and Europe."

He was simply not prepared to play it until such time as he had appreciated its inner logic. That time never came, but Wittgenstein and Prokofiev always remained on friendly terms. It was the only one of Prokofiev's complete piano concertos that never saw a performance during his lifetime. It was premiered in Berlin on 5 September 1956 by Siegfried Rapp and the West Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Martin Rich. The United States premiere was in 1958, by Rudolf Serkin and the Philadelphia Orchestra under Eugene Ormandy. The British premiere was in 1961, by Malcolm Binns.

The opera was commissioned by the Carl Rosa Opera Company and first produced at the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh on 15 November 1894 to great acclaim. The ending of the opera, in which Jeanie's sister, Effie Deans is freed from Tolbooth prison, is not in Scott's novel. The crowd scene in fact refers back to the beginning of the novel where the Porteous Riots are described. The plot of the opera, therefore, ends with the freeing of Effie, and the lives of Jeanie and her sister afterwards are not dealt with."

      "description": "Tesla – Lightning in His Hand is a large-scale opera about Serbian American scientist and inventor Nikola Tesla (1856 - 1943), composed by Tasmanian (Australian) composer Constantine Koukias (1965-), with libretto by Marianne Fisher. The full opera was produced in 2003 by IHOS Music Theatre and Opera, described at the time by Vincent Plush of Gramophone magazine as having created \"a quiet operatic revolution in Hobart since its formation in 1990\". There was nothing quiet, however, about the Tesla coil that was among the work's most notable props at its premiere. A warning was issued in the program to audience members who might be wearing \"pace-makers, hearing aides, or any form of electric, magnetic, mechanical or metallic implant or prosthetic device\". Tesla was one of the least recognised scientific pioneers in history, though his inventions formed the basis of modern industry. His developments in energy, such as the AC current, the polyphase motor and the wireless, catapulted the world into the automotive age. The opera follows the repeated reversals of fortunes of this charismatic and eccentric man who was, for a time, the darling of the New York set. Throughout his career he was variously championed and cheated by his shrewder peers and rivals, most memorably Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse. As a scientist Tesla was controversial; as a businessman he was a dismal failure. In Tesla - Lightning in His Hand, \"the electrical engineer's life and the intensity of his research is conveyed by the sense of escalating drama through the production\". Tesla - Lightning in His Hand was originally commissioned by the West Australian Opera and developed over three years through two staged \"works in development\". Creator and original Artistic Director of Tasmania's 10 Days on the Island Festival, Robyn Archer, commissioned the full opera to open the festival in 2003. In keeping with audience expectations of IHOS, built up through the innovation and spectacle of productions such as Days and Nights with Christ and To Traverse Water, the work, sponsored by the John Holland Group, was staged in a massive shed on Hobart's docks, where the Tesla coils put on a \"spectacular display of electron sparks\". Reviewing the production for the Melbourne Age, David Lander described it as \"gorgeous image-based performance art with a fascinating, brittle score in which dilemmas are ignored in favour of sensuality\". The two-hour work, sung in English, is in two parts and features a bass, a tenor, a bass-baritone, two sopranos, seven musicians (including a theremin player) and a large male choir. Throughout Part 1, \"the baritone and bass voices rise up in indecipherable incantations which weave through the plaintive and lyrical strains of an oboe\". Also audible are clattering typewriters, pigeons (in later life Tesla was deeply affected by the death of a specific white pigeon), Morse code and fragments of Antonín Dvořák's New World Symphony. Tesla was featured on ABC Classic FM's New Music Australia program and has been cited as far afield as Croatia, where it was noted in a tourist board tribute to the scientist and Croatian Post's web page detailing a stamp to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the inventor's birth."

It was written by Bernard de La Monnoye (1641–1728) and first published in Noël bourguignons in 1720. Its original title is \"Guillô, Pran Ton Tamborin\" (\"Willie, Bring Your Little Drum\" or \"Willie, Take Your Little Drum\"). The carol revolves around the birth of Jesus Christ, and is told from the perspective of shepherds playing simple instruments—flutes and drums—the onomatopoetic sound of which gives the song its name; \"patapan\" is meant to mimic the sound of the drum, and an accompanying lyric, \"tu-re-lu-re-lu,\" the flute. This is similar conceptually to the carol \"The Little Drummer Boy\", with its chorus of \"pa-rum-pa-pum-pum.\" Mannheim Steamroller recorded a version of the song on their 1995 album Christmas in the Aire. (The accompanying video plays during the group's live shows when the song is performed.) American singer-songwriter David Archuleta recorded a contemporary version of \"Pat-a-Pan\" on his 2009 album Christmas from the Heart. It was also recorded by Bing Crosby (1962) and Julie Andrews (1982). American Composer John Gerrish wrote Variations on a Burgundian Carol for 3 Recorders published by Associated Music Publishers in 1957, based on the Patapan theme. It was played by his three children at the composer's 100th birthday party. Pagan folk musician Damh The Bard recorded his version on the 2009 album, 'Tales Of The Crow Man', substituting Christian references in the lyrics with pagan ones to make it a celebration of the Winter Solstice."

The song is usually classified as a Spiritual because of its biblical and religious imagery. There are references to the \"Lord,\" \"a little book\" with a message of \"liberty,\" \"brothers,\" \"religion,\" \"paradise,\" \"pilgrims\" and the \"tree of life\" awaiting her after her hardships, referred to as \"trials.\" There is an allegory of the river Jordan, the crossing thereof representing the Christian experience of death as something which \"...chills the body but not the soul.\" The river/death allegory was popularised by John Bunyan in his classic, The Pilgrim's Progress and the wording echoes the teaching of Jesus, to \"...fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul.\" (Matthew 10:28)"

Lyrics are usually in Swahili or English. The name \"bongo flava\" is a corruption of \"bongo flavour\", where \"bongo\" is the plural form of the Swahili word ubongo, meaning \"brain\", and is a common nickname used to refer to Dar es Salaam, the city where the genre originated. In the bongo flava, the metaphor of \"brains\" may additionally refer to the cunning and street smarts of the mselah (see below). The term \"bongo flava\" was coined and first mentioned in 1996 by Radio One's 99.6 FM (one of the first private radio stations in Tanzania) Radio Dj Mike Mhagama who was trying to differentiate between American R & B and hip hop music through his popular radio show known as 'DJ Show' with that of local youngsters music that didn't have, at that time, an identity of its own. DJ Show was the first radio show that accepted young Tanzanian musicians influenced by American music to express themselves through singing and rapping. He said on air, \"After listening to \"R & B Flava\" titled 'No Diggity' from the United States,here comes \"Bongo Flava\" from Unique Sisters, one of our own.\" After he said that on the show, the term \"Bongo Flava\" stuck. The earliest and most reliable account of how \"Bongo flava\" found its way onto Tanzanian airways has Taji Luindi at the heart of the story.Taji Liundi also known as Master T, the original creator and producer of the Dj Show program had already started airing songs by fledgling local artistes since late 1994. Mike Mhagama later joined the popular program as an under-study to Master T. He went on to produce and present the show alone after Master T had left Radio One in 1996.\"Bongo flava\" existed well before the first audio or video recordings. The youth in Dar es salaam were rapping at beach concerts(organized by Joseph Kusaga who owned Mawingu Discothèque, later Mawingu Studios and now Clouds Media Group), local concert halls and taking part in the first official rap competition called Yo!Rap Bonanza series that were promoted by DJ Kim \"And the Boyz\" Magomelo. Some of the youth were organized with fancy names, some were solo or formed impromptu groups at the event to get a chance to grab the mic. An icon of the open performance artistes in the early 1990s was Adili or Nigga One. The first influential dub artiste of the genre was Saleh Jabir who rapped in Kiswahili over the instrumentals of Vanilla Ice's, \"Ice Ice Baby\", he was solely responsible for making Kiswahili a viable language to rap in. His version was so popular, it broke ranks by receiving mild airplay in the conservative National Radio Tanzania. The first official rap song to grace the Tanzanian airwaves. One of the earliest groups to actually record and deliver a CD to Radio One for airing was Mawingu band, an outfit that became hugely popular in early 1994. They recorded at Mawingu Studios. Its members were Othman Njaidi, Eliudi Pemba, Columba Mwingira, Sindila Assey, Angela, Robert Chuwa, Boniface Kilosa (a.k.a. Dj Boni Love) and later Pamela who sang the famous hook of their breakout first RnB/Rap single \"Oya Msela\". The song was so popular and ahead of its time that the Msela label stuck. 'Msela' is the Swahili word for 'ruffian'. Mawingu Band was arguably the pioneer of the RnB flavored type of Bongo flava. Dar Young Mob were the first real hip-hop stylized group to record with Mawingu Studios under budding producer Dj Boni Love. They were the first group to have their rap single aired on private radio in Tanzania.",

Garage punk is characterized by a dirty, choppy guitar sound— lyrics sometimes dealing with bad taste and rebelliousness, usually played by bands who are on independent record labels, or who are unsigned. Garage punk bands often distance themselves from hardcore punk bands and usually do not adhere to the kinds of strict subcultural codes and ideologies that are often associated with other forms of punk. The term is also sometimes used to refer to '60s garage bands, as well as to revivalist bands who have emulated them.",

He composed it in 1724 in Leipzig for Epiphany and first performed it on 6 January 1724. Bach wrote the cantata to conclude his first Christmas season in Leipzig which had been celebrated with five cantatas, four of them new compositions, the Magnificat and a new Sanctus. The text by an anonymous author, who possibly supplied texts of two of the Christmas cantatas as well, combines the prescribed readings for the feast day, the prophecy from the Book of Isaiah and the gospel of Matthew about the Wise Men from the East. The librettist begins with a quotation from the prophecy, comments it by a stanza of the early anonymous Christmas carol \"Ein Kind geborn zu Bethlehem\", says in a sequence of recitatives and arias that the prophecy was fulfilled in Bethlehem, concluding that the Christian should bring his heart as a gift. The cantata ends with a chorale, stanza 10 of Paul Gerhardt's hymn \"Ich hab in Gottes Herz und Sinn\". Bach scored the cantata in seven movements festively, for two vocal soloists (tenor and bass), a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two horns, two recorders, two oboes da caccia, strings and basso continuo. All recitatives are secco, but the full orchestra plays for the opening chorus, the last aria and the closing chorale."

It relates the journey of a pious man's soul from his deathbed to his judgment before God and settling into Purgatory. Elgar disapproved of the use of the term \"oratorio\" for the work, though his wishes are not always followed. The piece is widely regarded as Elgar's finest choral work, and some consider it his masterpiece. The work was composed for the Birmingham Music Festival of 1900; the first performance took place on 3 October 1900, in Birmingham Town Hall. It was badly performed at the premiere, but later performances in Germany revealed its stature. In the first decade after its premiere, the Roman Catholic dogma in Newman's poem caused difficulties in getting the work performed in Anglican cathedrals, and a revised text was used for performances at the Three Choirs Festival until 1910."

Originally, eight revolutionary operas were produced, eighteen by the end of the period. Instead of the \"emperors, kings, generals, chancellors, maidens, and beauties\" (diwang jiangxiang yahuan xiaojie) of the traditional Peking opera, which was banned as \"feudalistic and bourgeois,\" they told stories from China's recent revolutionary struggles against foreign and class enemies. They glorified the People's Liberation Army and the bravery of the common people, and showed Mao Zedong and his thought as playing the central role in the victory of socialism in China. Although they originated as operas, they soon appeared on LPs, in comic books, on posters, postcards, and stamps; on plates, teapots, wash basins, cigarette packages, vases, and calendars. They were performed or blasted from loudspeakers in schools, factories, and fields by special performing troupes. The Eight Model Operas dominated the stage in all parts of the country during these years, leading to the joke \"Eight hundred million people watched eight shows.\" (Bayi ren kan bage xi)."

      "description": "Khovanshchina (Russian: Хованщина, Hovánščina, sometimes rendered The Khovansky Affair; since the ending -ščina is pejorative) is an opera (subtitled a 'national music drama') in five acts by Modest Mussorgsky. Khovanskygate, the name given to a 2014 production in Birmingham, UK, is a modern equivalent. The work was written between 1872 and 1880 in St. Petersburg, Russia. The composer wrote the libretto based on historical sources. The opera was unfinished and unperformed when the composer died in 1881. Like Mussorgsky's earlier Boris Godunov, Khovanshchina deals with an episode in Russian history, first brought to the composer's attention by his friend the critic Vladimir Stasov. It concerns the rebellion of Prince Ivan Khovansky, the Old Believers, and the Muscovite Streltsy against the regent Sofia Alekseyevna and the two young Tsars Peter the Great and Ivan V, who were attempting to institute Westernizing reforms in Russia. Khovansky had helped to foment the Moscow Uprising of 1682, which resulted in Sofia becoming regent on behalf of her younger brother Ivan and half-brother Peter, who were crowned joint Tsars. In the fall of 1682 Prince Ivan Khovansky turned against Sofia. Supported by the Old Believers and the Streltsy, Khovansky — who supposedly wanted to install himself as the new regent — demanded the reversal of Patriarch Nikon's reforms. Sofia and her court were forced to flee Moscow. Eventually, Sofia managed to suppress the so-called Khovanshchina (Khovansky affair) with the help of the diplomat Fyodor Shaklovity, who succeeded Khovansky as leader of the Muscovite Streltsy. With the rebellion crushed, the Old Believers committed mass suicide (in the opera, at least). Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov completed, revised, and scored Khovanshchina in 1881–1882. Because of his extensive cuts and \"recomposition\", Dmitri Shostakovich revised the opera in 1959 based on Mussorgsky's vocal score, and it is the Shostakovich version that is usually performed. In 1913 Igor Stravinsky and Maurice Ravel made their own arrangement at Sergei Diaghilev's request. When Feodor Chaliapin refused to sing the part of Dosifei in any other orchestration than Rimsky-Korsakov's, Diaghilev's company employed a mixture of orchestrations which did not prove successful. The Stravinsky-Ravel orchestration was forgotten, except for Stravinsky's finale, which is still sometimes used. Although the background of the opera comprises the Moscow Uprising of 1682 and the Khovansky affair a few months later, its main themes are the struggle between progressive and reactionary political factions during the minority of Tsar Peter the Great and the passing of old Muscovy before Peter's westernizing reforms. It received its first performance in the Rimsky-Korsakov edition in 1886."

The song tells the story of a woman deserted by her lover when she needs him the most. The first historical record of the song was by ethnomusicologist John Lomax in 1909, who recorded it as sung by an African American woman called Dink, as she washed her man's clothes in a tent camp of migratory levee-builders on the bank of the Brazos River, a few miles from College Station, Texas and Texas A&M College. The first publication of the music was in American Ballads and Folk Songs, edited by Lomax and his son, Alan Lomax, and published by Macmillan in 1934. Gloria Lynne recorded the song for a concept album created and produced by Harry Belafonte titled Long Road to Freedom: An Anthology of Black Music. In Lynne's version the song is called \"Honey.\" The song was also recorded by Burl Ives (circa 1965). A different arrangement of the song was written and performed by Frank Black on his 2006 album Fast Man Raider Man. Puerto Rican singer Gabriel Ríos included the song on the limited edition 2-disc release of his album Angelhead. A brief excerpt of Oscar Isaac and Marcus Mumford's performance of \"Dink's Song\" is featured in the Coen Brothers's film Inside Llewyn Davis, as well as a complete, searing solo acoustic version by Isaac, self-accompanied on guitar.

      "description": "Clarinet Concerto No. 2 was the second clarinet concerto written by English composer Malcolm Arnold, his Opus 115. It was commissioned in 1974 by clarinetist Benny Goodman, who had given the American premiere of Arnold's first clarinet concerto in 1967. In the late 1960s, Goodman telephoned Arnold to commission the concerto; however, Arnold, believing the call to be a prank, yelled \"Sod off!\" and hung up on him. After this confusion was resolved, Arnold agreed to compose the piece. Upon its completion in April 1974, Goodman travelled to Dublin to collect the score. Arnold left it in his hotel room with flowers and a bottle of Jack Daniel's whiskey. Several hours later he received a call from Goodman, who noted: \"I may be a bit stoned but I think your concerto is just great!\" The concerto is tailored to Goodman's jazz background: the first movement, \"Allegro vivace\", includes a cadenza marked \"as jazzy and way out as you please\". \"Lento\", the second movement, is more lyrical, although Paul Serotsky suggests that \"this might have 'graced' some horror film\". The final movement, \"Allegro non troppo\", is also known as the \"Pre-Goodman Rag\", and is characterized by ragtime rhythms. The concerto was premiered at the Red Rocks Music Festival with Goodman and the Denver Symphony Orchestra. When it was first composed, few classical clarinetists were willing to attempt a performance because of the \"outrageous\" quality of the final movement. Jack Brymer was among the first, other than Goodman, to perform the work publicly, but did not record it. There have since been several recordings made by various musicians."

      "description": "Noise music is a category of music that is characterised by the expressive use of noise within a musical context. This type of music tends to challenge the distinction that is made in conventional musical practices between musical and non-musical sound. Noise music includes a wide range of musical styles and sound-based creative practices that feature noise as a primary aspect. It can feature acoustically or electronically generated noise, and both traditional and unconventional musical instruments. It may incorporate live machine sounds, non-musical vocal techniques, physically manipulated audio media, processed sound recordings, field recording, computer-generated noise, stochastic process, and other randomly produced electronic signals such as distortion, feedback, static, hiss and hum. There may also be emphasis on high volume levels and lengthy, continuous pieces. More generally noise music may contain aspects such as improvisation, extended technique, cacophony and indeterminacy, and in many instances conventional use of melody, harmony, rhythm and pulse is dispensed with. The Futurist art movement was important for the development of the noise aesthetic, as was the Dada art movement (a prime example being the Antisymphony concert performed on April 30, 1919 in Berlin), and later the Surrealist and Fluxus art movements, specifically the Fluxus artists Joe Jones, Yasunao Tone, George Brecht, Robert Watts, Wolf Vostell, Dieter Roth, Yoko Ono, Nam June Paik, Walter De Maria's Ocean Music, Milan Knížák's Broken Music Composition, early LaMonte Young and Takehisa Kosugi. Contemporary noise music is often associated with extreme volume and distortion. In the domain of experimental rock, examples include Jimi Hendrix's use of feedback, Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music, and Sonic Youth. Other examples of music that contain noise-based features include works by Iannis Xenakis, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Helmut Lachenmann, Cornelius Cardew, Theatre of Eternal Music, Glenn Branca, Rhys Chatham, Ryoji Ikeda, Survival Research Laboratories, Whitehouse, Ramleh , Coil, Brighter Death Now, Merzbow, Cabaret Voltaire, Psychic TV, Blackhouse, Jean Tinguely's recordings of his sound sculpture (specifically Bascule VII), the music of Hermann Nitsch's Orgien Mysterien Theater, and La Monte Young's bowed gong works from the late 1960s. Genres such as industrial, industrial techno, lo-fi music, black metal, sludge metal, and glitch music employ noise-based materials."

It is one of Schubert's six unfinished symphonies. It was begun in 1820 or 1821, with initial sketches made for the opening sections of the first, second, and fourth movements, and an almost complete sketch for the third movement. He abandoned this symphony after this initial phase of work and never returned to it, although Schubert would live for another seven years. British conductor and composer Brian Newbould, an authority on Schubert's music, has speculated that the symphony was left incomplete due to problems Schubert faced in orchestrating the sketch. In 2012, Newbould was commissioned by BBC Radio 3 to complete the symphony. He had previously completed three other unfinished symphonies by Schubert (the seventh, eighth, and tenth). At that time he had done work to make the existing fragments of D.708a performable, but this was his first attempt to go beyond the fragments and complete the entire structure. His completed version has been subsequently performed, recorded, published, and broadcast on BBC Radio 3."

Two years later, John Lomax published a substantially longer version as \"Zebra Dun\" in Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads. \"Zebra Dun\" was one of the most popular songs among the cowboys and is included in many song books. The singing cowboy, Jules Verne Allen, was the first to record it (Victor V-40022, 1928)."

      "description": "La Cenerentola, ossia La bontà in trionfo (Cinderella, or Goodness Triumphant) is an operatic dramma giocoso in two acts by Gioachino Rossini. The libretto was written by Jacopo Ferretti, based on the fairy tale Cendrillon by Charles Perrault. The opera was first performed in Rome's Teatro Valle on 25 January 1817. Rossini composed La Cenerentola when he was 25 years old, following the success of The Barber of Seville the year before. La Cenerentola, which he completed in a period of three weeks, is considered to have some of his finest writing for solo voice and ensembles. Rossini saved some time by reusing an overture from La gazzetta and part of an aria from The Barber of Seville and by enlisting a collaborator, Luca Agolini, who wrote the secco recitatives and three numbers (Alidoro's \"Vasto teatro è il mondo\", Clorinda's \"Sventurata!\" and the chorus \"Ah, della bella incognita\"). The facsimile edition of the autograph has a different aria for Alidoro, \"Fa' silenzio, odo un rumore\"; this seems to have been added by an anonymous hand for an 1818 production. For an 1820 revival in Rome, Rossini wrote a bravura replacement, \"La, del ciel nell'arcano profondo\". The light, energetic overture has been in the standard repertoire since its premiere as La Cenerentola."

It is his only violin concerto, written when he was 28, which was the time when the establishment of a professional conservatory in Russia was under discussion, thus the concerto was unjustly neglected. The three movements provide an admirable opportunity for virtuoso performance. However there is nothing particularly Russian about the work, rather showing the fine craftsmanship of a Mendelssohn and an undoubtedly professional technical command of structure and orchestration."

The écossaise was usually danced in 2/4 time. The musical form was also adopted by some classical composers including Franz Schubert, Ludwig van Beethoven and Frédéric Chopin who wrote a number of Ecossaises for the piano, which are recognized for their lively rhythm. This music usually has significant dynamic contrast — it will use fortissimos and pianissimos very close together. It has a unique dynamic energy to it. They sometimes have a central tune which some of the strains are based on. One by J. N. Hummel is in the second volume for piano in the Suzuki Method."

Dvořák began composition during May 1881, with an interruption in October 1881 to write a string quartet for the Hellmesberger Quartet. After an initial failed attempt, the quartet was completed in November 1881, allowing work on the opera to resume. The work was first performed in Prague, at the Nové České Divadlo (New Czech Theatre) on October 8, 1882. The work was first performed in the United States on March 24, 1984 in a concert format presented at Carnegie Hall in New York City by conductor Robert Bass and the Collegiate Chorale with Martina Arroyo as Marina. The libretto was originally written for Karel Šebor to set, but he proved highly unwilling to do so, so Červinková-Riegrová offered her work to Dvořák, who proved much more enthusiastic, but requested plenty of modifications to the libretto as it stood, including the introduction of more opportunities for ensembles. The form of the opera was largely in imitation of Eugène Scribe, and the plot was derived from Ferdinand Mikovec’s Dimitr Ivanovič, itself based upon Friedrich Schiller's incomplete Demetrius. With Dimitrij, Dvořák scored a great popular success, though he later persuaded his librettist to rework Act 4, and this revised version was given in 1885. Later still, he heavily reworked the opera along Wagnerian lines, and this radical version was performed during 1892."

Based on the greeting of the archangel Gabriel to the Virgin Mary in the Gospel of Luke, the prayer takes different forms in various traditions.

It was the first Christmas cantata Bach composed for Leipzig. The title of the cantata also appears in more modern German as Dazu ist erschienen der Sohn Gottes. The theme of the work is Jesus as the conqueror of the works of the devil, who is frequently mentioned as the serpent. The music is festively scored, using two horns, similar to Part IV of Bach's later Christmas Oratorio. The text by an unknown poet is organised in eight movements, beginning with a choral movement on the biblical text, followed by a sequence of recitatives and arias which is structured as three stanzas from three different hymns. Only two of these hymns are Christmas carols. Bach used the opening chorus for the concluding Cum Sancto Spiritu in his 1738 Missa in F major, BWV 233."

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, mainstream country music was dominated by the slick Nashville sound and the rock-influenced Bakersfield sound of artists like Merle Haggard. A new generation of country artists emerged, influenced by contemporary rock music, singer-songwriters such as Bob Dylan, and the liberal politics of the 1960s counterculture. Progressive country was a songwriter-based movement and many key artists had previously seen success writing for other artists in Nashville; writing for themselves, they were more concerned with expanding country music than creating hits. Foremost among these artists was Willie Nelson, who returned to Texas after deciding to focus on performing his own songs. Nelson soon attained a wide following and inspired other artists in Texas and Nashville. By the mid-1970s, progressive country artists entered the mainstream, usually in the form of cover versions by other artists. Progressive country also provided the basis for outlaw country, a harder-edged, more rock-oriented variant that achieved wide success in the late 1970s, as well as cowpunk and alternative country artists in the 1980s through today.",

It speaks about a dark hair lady that goes to the fountain to take a glass of water because it is said to be very good early in the morning. Its name comes from a fountain located in Santander. It is situated in the Avenida of Antonio Maura, close to the casino. Some authors believe its name is derived from Manuel Cacho who was a landlord of many terrains down the Sardinero. The song is now used by Racing de Santander fans to encourage their team at the beginning of each match although originally it had nothing to do with football. The song reads: Ayer te vi que subías,por la alameda primera,luciendo la saya blanca,y el pañueluco de seda. Dime donde vas morena,dime donde vas salada,dime donde vas morena,a las dos de la mañana. Voy a la fuente de Cacho,a beber un vaso de agua,que me han dicho que es muy buena,beberla por la mañana. Dime donde vas morena,dime donde vas salada,dime donde vas morena,a las dos de la mañana.

Handel composed Belshazzar in the late Summer of 1744 concurrently with Hercules, during a time that Winton Dean calls \"the peak of Handel's creative life\". The work premiered the following Lenten season on 27 March 1745 at the King's Theatre, London with Ann Turner Robinson as Daniel, John Beard (tenor) as Belshazzar/Gobrias and Henry Theodore Reinhold as Cyrus. The work fell into neglect after Handel's death, with revivals of the work occurring in the United Kingdom in 1847, 1848 and 1873."

Experiencing a renewal of faith, he went on to author many poems and hymns and was a preacher in addition to his merchant career. The song compares Jesus' love to the ocean in scope, emphasizing the limitless, unchanging, and sacrificial nature of God's affections for the singer and all of humanity. It consists of three stanzas each utilizing an A, A, B, B rhyming structure. Various melodic and harmonic arrangements of the song have been published, the most common being a minor melody in 3/4 time."

It was first published by composer Alexandra Zheleznova-Armfelt (1866–1933) in her collection Songs of the Ural Cossacks after her fieldwork in the Ural District during 1896–1897. The original title was (in pre-1917 orthography) Ой, не вечоръ, то-ли не вечоръ. (Сон Стеньки Разина.) The lyrics were reportedly recorded by \"75-year-old Cossack F. S. Zh.\". The original lyrics were in seven verses, with verse six making explicit that the dreamer is 17th century rebel Stepan Razin. Razin has a dream, and his captain (esaul) interprets it as an omen of their defeat. The song has been performed in several variants, sometimes expanded to up to eleven verses, but in the most common variant as sung by modern interpreters, it is reduced to four verses, removing the mention of Razin, and reducing the three omens in the dream to a single one. These lyrics may be translated as: The song became very popular during the 20th century and has been performed by numerous interpreters since the 1970s,including Ariel in the rock-opera \"The Legend of Yemelyan Pugachev\" (1978), Zhanna Bichevskaya (1996), Arkona (2004), Zolotoye Koltso(2007) and Valery Kipelov (2011).

Some sources say it was written with Parry's childhood sweetheart, Myfanwy Llywellyn, in mind, although the lyrics were probably inspired by the 14th-century love-story of Myfanwy Fychan of Castell Dinas Brân, Llangollen and the poet Hywel ab Einion. That story was also the subject of the popular poem, 'Myfanwy Fychan' (1858), by John Ceiriog Hughes (1832–87). The song is still a favourite with Welsh male voice choirs. A version has been performed by John Cale, Cerys Matthews on her album of Welsh greats, \"Tir\", and by Bryn Terfel on his album \"We'll Keep a Welcome\".

The words are by Cathal McGarvey (1866–1927) from Ramelton, County Donegal. The tune is similar to several other works, especially that of the English \"Dives and Lazarus\", also called \"Kingsfold\", well known from several popular hymns. The melody was also used in an Irish folk song called \"My Love Nell\". The lyrics of \"My Love Nell\" tell the story of a young man who courts a girl but loses her when she emigrates to America. The only real similarity with \"Star of the County Down\" is that Nell too comes from County Down. This may have inspired McGarvey to place the heroine of his new song in Down as well.[citation needed] McGarvey was from Donegal. \"The Star of the County Down\" uses a tight rhyme scheme. Each stanza is a double quatrain, and the first and third lines of each quatrain have an internal rhyme on the second and fourth feet: [aa]b[cc]b. The refrain is a single quatrain with the same rhyming pattern. The song is sung from the point of view of a young man who chances to meet a charming lady by the name of Rose (or Rosie) McCann, referred to as the \"star of the County Down\". From a brief encounter the writer's infatuation grows until, by the end of the ballad, he imagines wedding the girl. The song usually begins with the opening verse:"

Much of the material, including some plot similarities (with the flautist Frederick the Great substituted by the flautist Peter the Great), derived from Meyerbeer's earlier 1844 Singspiel Ein Feldlager in Schlesien. However, there also are some significant differences, perhaps the most important of which is that it was permissible to actually have Peter the Great take part in the action, which was not the case for Frederick, who had to play his flute off-stage. Peter does more than just take part in the action, since he ends up being the romantic lead. A notable feature of the opera is the triple march in the finale to the second act. A rebellion against the Tsar is deflected as the \"sacred march\" is heard. The troops are then joined by a regiment of grenadiers from Tobolsk, to the music of a different march, followed by a regiment of Tatar cavalry to the music of a third march."

In June 2011, through a Supreme Decree the Morenada was declared Intangible Cultural Heritage of the Plurinational State of Bolivia, according to the government, this measure was taken to stop the attempts of appropriation by neighbor countries.

The dance is notably performed outside of South America by Bolivian emigrants.[citation needed] Caporales and presented to the public for the first time in 1969 by the Estrada Pacheco brothers, who were inspired in the Afro-Bolivian Saya and the character of the 'Caporal' this is the overseer of the black slaves and was usually mixed race, wore boots and held a whip, a dance that belongs to the region of the Yungas, Bolivia. The dance, however, has a prominent religious aspect. One supposedly dances for The Virgin of Socavón (patroness of miners), or the Virgin of Candelaria, and promises to dance for three years of one's life. Caporal or caporales today is a folklore dance very popularly in the festivities of not only Bolivia, but also Argentina, Chile, and Peru. In June 2011, through a Supreme Decree Caporales was declared Intangible Cultural Heritage of the Plurinational State of Bolivia. There are many groups in the US that do these dances, such as Centralistas San Miguel Virginia, Orgullo Boliviano, ICLRI, Alma Boliviana, San Simon Universitartio Virginia, FFBRI, San Simon USA, Sangre Boliviana, Fraternidad Folklorica Y Cultural Ruphay, and much more. A male caporal dress depicts an old Spanish military guard (overseer of slaves). Wearing heeled boots bearing large bells known as \"cascabeles\", a male dancer carries a hat in his left hand and a whip in his right(sometimes). Even some girls will dance in a male role, as girls used to be relegated to wearing extremely short skirts and do less impressive steps; some may refer to them as \"chinas\" or \"machas\". A female caporal dress consists of a minidress with matching panties, skin-color pantyhose, fancy high-heeled shoes, and a round top hat pinned to her hair. The style and colours of the dress are maintained the same for both the men and women of a certain group, but can vary drastically between groups. Men and women usually dance separately in a progressive march style dance. Caporales is a dance where you jump a lot and is very active in this way. The dance is often mistaken for the Afro-Bolivian Saya, a confusion partly due to popular Caporales song texts like the ones composed by the popular Bolivian group \"Los Kjarkas\"; this group makes many Bolivian songs. Also this is due to an international ballet version of Saya Caporal being danced as \"Modern Saya\" (see Afro-Bolivian Saya). However, caporales derive from 'Saya': as the 'caporal' was a character in 'saya' when the Caporales dance was created in the late 1960s by the Estrada Pacheco family, they claimed to have been inspired by the performance of some Afro-Bolivian dancers from the Yungas region. The music is clearly of African origen and the bit of the drums are the steps of the mixture of 'saya' and 'negritos'. The rhythm is slightly different from the 'Saya'. This dance became one of the most popular dances in Bolivia, especially appreciated by young people of the middle and upper class who identified themselves with 'the caporal' and the macho antics of the dance, they form huge Caporales groups for Carnival, Gran Poder and other \"entradas\".",

The music was composed within a week, with a further week being spent in preparations for the production. Its success was welcome after the failure of Barkouf a fortnight earlier. Taken as a whole, this operetta has never really formed part of what may be termed the standard repertoire, but despite this, and especially during the period prior to the First World War, the title song remained extremely popular as a recital item, and indeed the writer of Offenbach's obituary in The Times considered the song itself to be one of his best compositions along with Orpheus in the Underworld and La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein – with La belle Hélène following behind these \"at some distance\". Offenbach had composed music for the song of Fortunio in act 2, scene 3, of Le Chandelier by Alfred de Musset for a revival of the play in 1850 at the Comédie-Française and this was published (by Heugel) as part of Offenbach's collection of songs Les voix mystérieuses in 1853, and taken up enthusiastically by the tenor Gustave-Hippolyte Roger in his concerts. The librettists based their one-act La chanson de Fortunio around this song – with the story as a sort of sequel to the original play, the melody of the song being heard in the overture. Messager composed an opera Fortunio (1907) based on the Musset play; Fortunio's song from that work was also set in Russian by Tchaikovsky as the first of his six Romances, Op. 28."

Miller in 1893. The original sheet music described the song as \"A Comic Negro Absurdity\" on the back page and provided an additional eight verses as well as a final chorus. \"The Cat Came Back\" has since entered the folk tradition and been recorded under variations of the title—\"But the Cat Came Back\", \"And the Cat Came Back\", etc. It is also a popular children's song. The song is humorous in nature, telling a silly tale about \"ole Mister Johnson\" who had an \"ole yaller cat\" that he did not want, and when he tried to get rid of the cat, the cat kept coming back: In Miller's original, the cat finally died when an organ grinder came around one day and: Even then the cat's ghost came back. The first commercial recording of the song was ca. 1894 for the Columbia Phonograph Company, Washington D.C., performed by Charles Marsh. \"The Cat Came Back\" was later recorded by Fiddlin' John Carson (OKeh catalog #40119) in April 1924.

The rhythms of apala grew more complex over time, influenced by Cuban music and eventually became quite popular in Nigeria. Instruments include a rattle (sekere), thumb piano (agidigbo) and a bell (agogô), as well as two or three talking drums. Haruna Ishola is undoubtedly the best-known performer of apala in Nigerian history. Others may hold a contrary view that Ayinla Omowura is better known, and the most successful musician of Apala. Both of them played an integral role in the popularization of the genre, and it is distinct from, older than, and much more difficult to master than fuji music. Although Ayninla Omowura died in his forties in 1980, he recorded more than 20 LPs and remarkably, all are very successful. Although Fuji music remains the most important form of traditional music amongst Yorubas in Nigeria, apala is still very popular amongst Muslims of the Yoruba tribe. Special mention must be given to Haruna Ishola's son, Musiliu Haruna Ishola, who is often credited with revitalizing the apala genre and spearheading the apala-resurgence of the 2000s. With his 2000 album (entitled Soyoyo), Musiliu has succeeded in bringing apala music to a wider, younger audience, thus breathing new life to the genre and keeping the tradition (and his father's legacy) alive. He is credited with re-popularizing a genre that was fast becoming the preserve of older Muslims of the Yoruba tribe. The success of his Soyoyo album meant that a younger (often Christian or Animist) generation of Yorubas have now demonstrated a renewed interest in apala music. His songs can often be heard on popular radio stations across Yorubaland.",

It is also sung at occasions such as the entrance of Cardinals to the Sistine Chapel, when electing a new pope, as well as at the consecration of bishops, the ordination of priests, when celebrating the sacrament of Confirmation, the dedication of churches, the celebration of synods or councils, the coronation of kings, the profession of members of religious institutes and other similar solemn events. The hymn is also widely used in the Anglican Communion and appears, for example, in the Ordering of Priests and in the Consecration of Bishops in the Book of Common Prayer, 1662. It has been translated into several languages; one English example is Creator Spirit! by whose aid, written 1690 by John Dryden and published in The Church Hymn book 1872 (n. 313). Martin Luther used it as the basis for his chorale for Pentecost \"Komm, Gott Schöpfer, Heiliger Geist\", first published in 1524. Gustav Mahler set the Latin text to music in Part I of his Symphony No. 8 in E-flat major. The text has been set for chorus and orchestra by Cristóbal Halffter. A motet for women's voices to the text was among the last works of Hector Berlioz. Krzysztof Penderecki wrote a motet for mixed choir, and Paul Hindemith concludes his Concerto for Organ and Orchestra with a Phantasy on \"Veni Creator Spiritus.\" Maurice Duruflé used the chant tune as the basis for his symphonic organ composition \"Prélude, Adagio et Choral varié sur le thème du 'Veni Creator'\" in 1930. Michael John Trotta's setting incorporates the first two lines of this hymn along with the text from Veni Sancte Spiritus in a 21st-century setting for choir."

      "description": "Jephtha (HWV 70) is an oratorio (1751) by Handel with a libretto by the Rev. Thomas Morell, based on the story of Jephtha in Judges (Chapter 11) and Jephthas sive votum - \"Jeptha or the Vow\" (1554) by George Buchanan. Whilst writing Jephtha, Handel was increasingly troubled by his gradual loss of sight, and this proved to be his last oratorio. In the autograph score, at the end of the chorus \"How dark, O Lord, are thy decrees\" he wrote \"Reached here on 13 February 1751, unable to go on owing to weakening of the sight of my left eye.\" The story revolves around Jephtha's rash promise to the Almighty that if he is victorious, he will sacrifice the first creature he meets on his return. He is met by his beloved daughter Iphis. Unlike the original Biblical story, an angel intervenes to stop the sacrifice, and Iphis only needs to dedicate her life to the Lord. In contrast, the Biblical story strongly implies that her father chose to sacrifice her, but a short reprieve is arranged, after which Iphis dutifully returns and was killed. Scholars disagree regarding whether he actually sacrificed her or if, as the oratorio relates, she was then dedicated to the Lord and required to observe a life of perpetual virginity. Regardless, however, the Bible makes no mention of an angel stopping what occurred. Staged performance of material based on biblical subjects was forbidden in Great Britain at the time the work was premiered. Handel's final masterpiece was presented at the Covent Garden on 26 February 1752, with the composer conducting, and with a cast that included John Beard (tenor) as Jephtha and two divas of the opera stage, Giulia Frasi, Handel's prima donna since 1749, and Caterina Galli. It was presented without scenery or costumes, divided into three acts. Jephtha is principally remembered for the dramatic recitative Deeper, and deeper still, and the aria Waft her, angels, thro' the skies, one of Handel's most beautiful airs. The two passages occur separately within the oratorio, but during the 19th century these were often performed together in concert, as if the recitative directly preceded the aria.[citation needed]"

This was made up of married couples who lived in small cottages and single men who lived together in a bothy, or shelter. In order to entertain themselves and the other members of the toun, the young men of the bothy would hold musical evenings, the bothy nichts, with the music provided by their own impromptu band, the bothy band. A good band might well become known outside the toun, and be in demand for local events such as dances."

      "description": "The sensitive style (German: empfindsamer Stil), empfindsam style, or tender style is a style of musical composition and poetry developed in 18th-century Germany, intended to express \"true and natural\" feelings, and featuring sudden contrasts of mood. The German noun Empfindsamkeit is usually translated as sensibility (in the sense used by Jane Austen), while the adjective empfindsame is sometimes rendered as sentimental or ultrasensitive (). Empfindsamkeit is also sometimes translated, and may even be derived from the English word sentimentality, since it is related to the contemporary English sentimentality literary movement (, 46). It was developed as a contrast to the Baroque Affektenlehre (lit. \"The Doctrine of Affections\"), in which a composition (or movement) would have the same affect, or emotion, throughout.[citation needed] The empfindsamer Stil is similar to and often considered a dialect of the international galant style, which is marked by simple homophonic textures and periodic melodies (, xvii; ). Empfindsamkeit, however—unlike the broader galant style—tends to avoid lavish ornamentation (, xvii). The dramatic fluidity that was a goal of the empfindsamer Stil has encouraged historians to view mid-century Empfindsamkeit as a slightly earlier parallel to the showier and stormier phase called Sturm und Drang (storm and stress) that emerged around 1770 (). These two trends are together regarded as \"pre-Romantic\" manifestations, because of their emphasis on features such as extreme expressive contrasts with disruptive incursions, instability of key, sudden changes of register, dynamic contrast, and exciting orchestral effects, all of which are atypical of musical classicism as practiced in the second half of the eighteenth century (, 903). The empfindsamer Stil is especially associated with the so-called Berlin School at the Prussian court of Frederick the Great. Traits characteristic for composers of this school are a particular fondess for Adagio movements and precise attention to ornaments and dynamics (, 46–47), as well as the liberal use of appoggiaturas (\"sigh\" figures) and frequent melodic and harmonic chromaticism (). Composers in this style include: Poets in this style include:"

And after a phone conversation with Disk, it was later \"coined\" and used in 1995 by DJ Babu to describe the difference between a DJ who simply plays records and one who performs by physically manipulating the records, stylus, and mixer to produce sounds. The new term coincided with the resurgence of hip-hop DJing in the 1990s. John Oswald described the art: \"A phonograph in the hands of a 'hiphop/scratch' artist who plays a record like an electronic washboard with a phonographic needle as a plectrum, produces sounds which are unique and not reproduced—the record player becomes a musical instrument.\" Some turntablists use turntable techniques like beat mixing/matching, scratching, and beat juggling. Some turntablists seek to have themselves recognized as traditional musicians capable of interacting and improvising with other performers."

      "description": "Christ lag in Todes Banden (also spelled Todesbanden ) (\"Christ lay in death's bonds\" or \"Christ lay in the snares of death\"), BWV 4, is a cantata for Easter by the German composer Johann Sebastian Bach. One of his earliest church cantatas, it was probably intended for a performance in 1707, an early work in the genre to which he later contributed complete cantata cycles for all occasions of the liturgical year. It was related to his application for a post at a Lutheran church at Mühlhausen. John Eliot Gardiner describes it as Bach's \"first-known attempt at painting narrative in music\". Christ lag in Todes Banden is a chorale cantata, a style in which both text and music are based on a hymn. In this instance the source was Martin Luther's hymn of the same name, the main hymn for Easter in the Lutheran church. The composition is based on the seven stanzas of the hymn and its tune, which was derived from Medieval models. In the format of chorale variations \"per omnes versus\" (for all stanzas), in each of the seven vocal movements Bach used the unchanged words of a stanza of the chorale, and its tune as a cantus firmus. After an opening sinfonia, the variations are arranged symmetrically: chorus–duet–solo–chorus–solo–duet–chorus, with the focus on the central fourth stanza about the battle between Life and Death. Although all movements are in E minor, Bach achieves variety and intensifies the meaning of the text through many other musical forms and techniques. Christ lag in Todes Banden is Bach's first cantata for Easter – in fact his only extant original composition for the first day of the feast – and his earliest surviving chorale cantata. He later repeatedly performed it as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, beginning in 1724 when he first celebrated Easter there. Only this second version survives: it is scored for four vocal parts with a choir of one cornetto and three trombones doubling the choral voices, plus a string section of two violins, two violas and continuo. This exemplifies a 17th-century \"Choralkonzert\" (chorale concerto) style; the lost scoring of the earlier performances was perhaps similar. Gardiner calls Bach's setting of Luther's hymn \"a bold, innovative piece of musical drama\", and observes \"his total identification with the spirit and letter of Luther's fiery, dramatic hymn\"."

The Italian libretto had been partly prepared Bartolomeo Merelli (about whose tardiness the composer complained), based on the French play, Gonzalve de Cordoue ou Grenade Reconquise by Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian (1791), and on a libretto by Luigi Romanelli to an opera by Nicolini called Abenamet e Zoraide.When Donizetti arrived in Rome, carrying a letter of introduction from his teacher and mentor Johann Simon Mayr to poet and librettist Jacopo Ferretti, he secured his help in revising Merelli's text. Although it was Donizetti's first theatrical success \"and the opera in which he began to adopt 'Rossinian' techniques\", the original 1822 version of this violent love story was never given a complete performance because Amerigo Sbigoli, the tenor originally cast in the role of Abenamet, died shortly before the first night, with no replacement available. Donizetti quickly adapted this role for contralto, though omitting three numbers in the process. The first performance took place at the Teatro Argentina, Rome, on 28 January 1822 and it and its composer received great acclaim in the weekly Notizie del giorno: The opera was presented in a revised edition at the same theatre on 7 January 1824, and given a revival in Lisbon in 1825."

Nono himself and Yuri Lyubimov wrote the libretto. It premiered at the Teatro alla Scala on 4 April 1975, conducted by Claudio Abbado. Lyubimov directed the original production. The UK premiere was at the 32nd Edinburgh Festival in 1978. In addition to vocal soloists, chorus and orchestra, the work incorporates taped sounds. This work is a product of Nono's strong political activism through the mid-1970s."

      "description": "Bianca e Fernando (Bianca and Fernando) is an opera in two acts by Vincenzo Bellini. The original version of this opera was presented as Bianca e Gernando and was set to a libretto by Domenico Gilardoni, based on Bianca e Fernando alla tomba di Carlo IV, duca di Agrigento (Bianca and Ferdinand at the Tomb of Charles IV, Duke of Agrigento), a play by Carlo Roti which is set in Sicily. In 1826, use of the name Fernando in the title was forbidden because Ferdinando was the name of the heir to the throne, and no form of it could be used on a royal stage. The 1826 work—Bellini's first professionally staged opera—had its first performance at the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples on 30 May 1826. Its success resulted the offer to the young composer from Domenico Barbaja, the Intendente at the San Carlo and also part of the management of La Scala opera house in Milan, of a commission to write a new opera for La Scala. The revival of Bianca e Gernando, with the title reverting to the original one proposed for the opera, came about after the success of Il pirata in Milan in October 1827. A commission came from Genoa in early 1828, too late for Bellini to write anything new. However, he did re-arrange the music to suit the singers' voices and in addition (as Galatopoulos states), Romani took on the re-construction of the libretto with the result that \"out of the whole of Bianca, the only pieces entirely unchanged are the big duet and the romanza; everything else is altered, and about half of it is new\". For this later production, Bellini specifically rejected a request by Gilardoni to revise the libretto, preferring instead Felice Romani, whom he regarded as the superior poet."

According to Michael Kennedy, the composer took first inspiration for the opera from this question to Bruce Richmond, editor of The Times Literary Supplement, around 1909–1910: Vaughan Williams worked on the opera for a number of years, before and after World War I. The work did not receive its first performance until 4 July 1924 at the Royal College of Music, London, in performances described as \"private dress rehearsals\". The \"professional premiere\" was at His Majesty's Theatre on 14 July 1924. The opera's first performance in the United States took place on 21 February 1928 under the auspices of the Washington National Opera, a semi-professional company not related to its present namesake. Tudor Davies created the role of Hugh in both these productions. The opera was performed by the professional Canadian Opera Company in Toronto in November 1929, at the Royal Alexandra Theatre in Toronto, with a live radio broadcast from the Royal York Hotel on 13 November 1929. In the broadcast, hockey broadcaster Foster Hewitt provided narrative for the fight sequence. These Toronto performances were conducted by Sir Ernest MacMillan, music director of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra from 1931 to 1955, and featured American tenor Allan Jones in the title role of Hugh. Jones would soon become a Hollywood star. Vaughan Williams continued to revise the libretto and the opera over the remainder of his life. The final version was performed in 1956 and published in 1959. The opera has set numbers with recitatives. It has been described as a modern example of a ballad opera. Contemporary comment noted the use of humour and the role of the chorus in the work, in the context of developing English opera."

      "description": "Jugni is an age-old narrative device used in Punjabi folk music and sung at Punjabi weddings in India, Pakistan, US, Canada, Australia and UK. The word literally means 'Female Firefly', in folk music it stands in for the poet-writer who uses Jugni as an innocent observer to make incisive, often humorous, sometimes sad but always touching observations. In spiritual poetry Jugni means the spirit of life, or essence of life. Alam Lohar (Punjab, Pakistan) and singer and humorist Asa Singh Mastana (Punjab, India) are credited with popularizing this poetry from early Sufi spiritual writings and then subsequently later on it was transformed by other singers as a female girl just like prefixes like Preeto. Much of early Jugni writing is spiritual in nature and relates to one's understanding of the world and one's relationship with God. Many poet philosophers have used the Jugni device, which is in the public domain, to make social, political or philosophical, often mildly subversive, commentary. Jugni is cross religious and depending on the writer, invokes the name of God (often using the word \"Saeen\", the vernacular word for Lord), Ali or the Gurus. A kernel of truth is an essential and integral part of every Jugni composition. Noting, Jugni is also an old Muslim worship tool, majorly named as TASBIH, a series of 21, 31, 51 or 101 pearls, which is used by SUFI SAINTS for practicing the holy words. Mainly it is made by white pearls and white thread and is known to be holy. Afterwords JUGNI has become an ornament for Punjabi Women. The narrative style relies on Jugni landing up unexpectedly in diverse places and, wide-eyed, learning something new. Jugni makes her comments in three or four well wrought verses which may or may not rhyme but can always be sung in a rudimentary Punjabi folk style. The object could be a city, a state, a market place, a school, a religious place or a saloon, Jugni's non-malicious commentary catches the essence of the place and produces in the listener a chuckle and sometimes a lump in the throat. Alam Lohar is the writer or introducer of this term from reading Baba Bulleh Shahs writing, in a spiritual Sufi theme. The Indian artist to make a mark was Asa Singh Mastana. More recently[when?], Kuldeep Manak, born Latif Mohammad, has made notable Jugni contributions. Apart from that every other pop or folk singer from Harbhajan Mann, Arif Lohar, Gurdas Maan, Gurmeet Bawa to Rabbi Shergill has had his Jugni moment. Bollywood movie Oye Lucky, Lucky Oye has at least three songs that use the word Jugni. The song was sung by Des Raj Lachkani (basically a dadi singer), Lachkani is a village near Patiala, India. In Pakistan, Jugni was popularized by the late folk music singer Alam Lohar. He received a gold disc LP for his Jugni in 1965. After that Saleem Javed and Arif Lohar, Alam Lohar's son, among others, have kept the tradition alive. Arif has brought in a more contemporary touch by incorporating modern vibes and rock influence in his versions of Jugni with Mukhtar Sahota (notably in his album \"21st century Jugni\"). In popular Pakistani culture Alamgir's Jugni is often the most-commonly recognized, which, in the mid-80's, encouraged young college students, most notably Saad Zahur, an architecture student at Lahore's NCA, who popularized the song with their own renditions. Arif Lohar has currently sang it for Coke Studio in Pakistan along with Meesha Shafi, a popular Pakistani youth, a version that will help this iconic song to further live on and on. This version of Jugni has crossed eleven million views and is most popular Punjabi video on YouTube."

The choice of the three solo instruments effectively makes this a concerto for piano trio, and it is the only concerto Beethoven ever completed for more than one solo instrument. A typical performance takes approximately thirty-seven minutes. Beethoven's early biographer Anton Schindler claimed that the Triple Concerto was written for Beethoven's royal pupil, the Archduke Rudolf of Austria. The Archduke, who became an accomplished pianist and composer under Beethoven's tutelage, was only in his mid-teens at this time, and it seems plausible that Beethoven's strategy was to create a showy but relatively easy piano part that would be backed up by two more mature and skilled soloists. However, there is no record of Rudolf ever performing the work—it was not publicly premiered until 1808, at the summer \"Augarten\" concerts in Vienna—and when it came to be published, the concerto bore a dedication to a different patron: Prince Lobkowitz (Franz Joseph Maximilian Fürst von Lobkowitz)."

They are overwhelmed by the city's chaos, its sexual temptations and its then-current affectation for French culture, and taken advantage of by city residents such as Lola, the Spanish courtesan, and Figueiredo, the procurer. At the end, the family finds Gouveia and returns to their home in Minas Gerais, and the landowner realizes that Brazil's prosperity comes from the honest labor to be found in the country, rather than from city life and frivolity. In 1923 it was made into a film.[citation needed]"

      "description": "\"The Happy Wanderer\" (\"Der fröhliche Wanderer\" or \"Mein Vater war ein Wandersmann\") is a popular song. The original text was written by Florenz Friedrich Sigismund (1788-1857). The present tune was composed by Friedrich-Wilhelm Möller shortly after World War II. It is often mistaken for a German folk song, but it is actually an original composition. His sister Edith Möller conducted a small amateur children's and youth choir in Schaumburg County, Northern Germany, internationally named Obernkirchen Children's Choir, in Germany named Schaumburger Märchensänger. She adapted Sigismund's words for her choir. In 1953 a BBC radio broadcast of the choir's winning performance at the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod turned the song into an instant hit. On January 22, 1954, the song entered the UK singles chart and stayed on the chart—only a Top 12 at the time—for 26 non-consecutive weeks, peaking at Number 2 (for five consecutive weeks). With the BBC's strong international influence \"The Happy Wanderer\" turned up everywhere, e.g., as the winning song of the 1955 calypso road-march season of the Trinidad Carnival. People protested after this event and complained that only calypsoes should be chosen over foreign music. The amateur choir, many of whose original members were war orphans, turned into an unlikely international phenomenon in the following years. The group performed on many international tours under the name Obernkirchen Children's Choir and recorded several albums. They made two appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show (November 29, 1964, and December 11, 1966). Die Isarspatzen, Herbert Beckh und das Tanzorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks have also recorded a German version. That version was made in Munich on June 16, 1954. It was released by Electrola as catalog number EG 8073. The song's German lyrics have been translated into several languages, and it has since become a choir classic. The first adaptation into another language was done by a Belgian woman, Andrée Mazy, who came up with versions in Dutch-Flemish and French. Since in Dutch folk songs \"valderi-valdera\" (pronounced \"falderi-faldera\") is more common than the German \"falleri-fallera\", she used the Dutch model in both versions. When Antonia Ridge was writing the English lyrics, she became acquainted with the French version of the song, with \"valderi-valdera\", pronounced with a true soft /v/ instead of the voiceless /f/, and borrowed it over into the English version mainly for euphonic reasons (less military sounding). Milton DeLugg wrote a noted arrangement, and is sometimes incorrectly credited as the composer of the song. A number of English-language sources credit Edith Möller and Florenz Siegesmund with writing the words, the implication being (apparently) that they were written at the same time as the tune. However, the German sources all credit the original words to either Friedrich Sigismund, F. Sigismund, or Florenz Friedrich Sigismund and give the dates as either 1788-1857 or early 19th century. All German sources agree that the words to the popular version were adapted by Edith Möller."

Scored for 2 oboes, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, and strings, in three movements: Charles Sherman finds the first movement \"noteworthy for the length of its development section (nearly equal in number of measures to the exposition and to the recapitulation) and for the persistence with which it treats a motive derived\" from the main theme. Another unusual feature of the first movement is that it ends piano, something rare even in the following century (for example, Beethoven's Eighth and Bruckner's Eighth). Scholars are not sure why the second movement is called \"La Confidenza\" (\"the secret communication\"). It changes from a slow tempo and 3/4 time to a faster tempo in 2/4. The horns are dismissed for this slow movement, but the two bassoons stay and are given independent parts. The last movement is a fast rondo in 3/8, which this symphony has in common with the others Haydn wrote at about the same time."

The libretto was translated and adapted by the composer from the novel by Dostoyevsky. It was the composer's last opera, premiered on 12 April 1930 in Brno, two years after his death. Janáček worked on this opera knowing that it would be his last, and for it he broke away from the habit he had developed of creating characters modeled on his love interest Kamila Stösslová, although the themes of loneliness and isolation can clearly be seen as a response to her indifference to his feelings. There is only one female character, and the setting, a Siberian prison, presents a large ensemble cast instead of one or several prominent leads. There is no narrative to the work as a whole, but individual characters narrate episodes in their lives, and there is a \"play-within-a-play\" in Act 2. From the House of the Dead was virtually finished when Janáček died. Two of his students, believing the orchestration was incomplete, \"filled out\" large portions of the score and adapted the ending to be more optimistic in tone. In addition to the work of Bretislav Bakala, Ota Zitek made changes to the text and sequence of events in the opera. Decades later, a version closer to the composer's intentions superseded that version, and it is the one most often heard today. Some productions, however, still use the earlier version's ending to lessen the bleakness of the story. The opera requires a vast orchestra, including chains as a percussion instrument to evoke the sound of the prisoners."

It was commissioned by the Kiev Military District's political office for the District Song and Dance Ensemble, as part of a suite in honour of Grigory Kotovsky, leader of two Moldovan rebellions in Bessarabia Governorate against the Russian Empire in 1905 and 1915. It is written in the style of a Moldovan folk song. The song was intended to glorify the female partisans of the Russian Civil War. The lyrics tell how the singer met a pretty girl gathering grapes and tried to seduce her, but how the girl turns out to be a partisan, and convinces him to join the partisans as well. The song was not performed as part of the suite as it was considered too frivolous. In 1940, songs composed for the troops on the front were supposed to be about revenge and victory. By 1942, fashions had changed, and songs with more romantic or lyrical themes were accepted by the military, so Novikov decided to re-release a revised version of the song. But it was again shelved for another two years, and its first performance came in 1944, in the Tchaikovsky Concert Hall in Moscow, by the Alexandrov Ensemble, with soloist Nikolaiy Ustinov. It was an immediate success, and had to be repeated three times as the audience requested encores. Because of its publication[clarification needed] outside of its original context of the Kotovsky Suite, it was now taken as a reference to the then-contemporary Soviet partisans of the Great Patriotic War (WWII). Goncharova (2010) notes that the image of the pretty Moldovan partisan is a lyrical fantasy, as out of some 3,000 known Soviet partisans active in Moldova, only seven were ethnic Moldovans. Smuglyanka was used in the 1973 Soviet film Only \"Old Men\" Are Going to Battle (В бой идут одни \"старики\"), an \"easy movie about love, airplanes and girls\" (Goncharova 2010). In the film, a young fighter pilot introduces the song to his squadron and so gets nicknamed \"the dark girl\". The film was first shown on 27 December 1973. Hero of the Soviet Union Alexander Pokryshkin was reportedly wiping his eyes as the lights came back on. The film became a blockbuster, seen by 54 million viewers within five months, and Smuglyanka as a consequence became known throughout the Soviet Union, entering the standard repertoire of Russian folk songs. Shvedov had not been told about the use of his song in the film, and learned about it from movie-going friends."

From the very beginning the opera's libretto has existed in three different languages: English (from the original play), French (for the French premiere) and German (for the German premiere). It premiered using the French-language version on RTF radio on 15 May 1961 and had its stage debut in Paris on 3 July 1961 at the Théâtre des Nations. The original stage production was performed by visiting artists from the Städtische Bühnen, notably American baritone William Dooley singing the title role. The work was next performed at the Städtische Bühnen on February 1962 with Dooley singing the role in German. Krapp, ou, La dernière bande received its United Kingdom premiere on 7 May 1999 with the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Diego Masson with the baritone David Barrell in the title role.

It has been produced in English under the title The Little Michus. Dismayed by the Paris reception for his 1896 piece, Le Chevalier d’Harmental, Messager retreated to London vowing to write no more. But when he received the libretto for Les p'tites Michu in 1897 from Vanloo and Duval, he was inspired to finish the new operetta in three months. Encouraged by this success, the same team produced Messager's most successful operetta, Véronique, in 1898."

It was Honegger’s third operatic work, but his first in lighter vein, composed between May and November 1930, and dedicated to Fernand Ochsé. Excluding dialogue, there is around 75 minutes of music, making it longer than many of his more serious works. While showing the influence of Mozart, Chabrier and Messager, it contains a wide range of orchestral colours with occasional glances at jazz of the 1930s."

      "description": "I puritani (The Puritans) is an opera in three acts by Vincenzo Bellini, although it was originally written with two acts and changed to three acts on the advice of Gioachino Rossini with whom the young composer had become friendly. The music was set to a libretto by Count Carlo Pepoli, an Italian émigré poet who Bellini had met at a salon run by the exile Princess Belgiojoso, which became a meeting place for many Italian revolutionaries. The subject was Têtes Rondes et Cavalieres (Roundheads and Cavaliers), written by Jacques-François Ancelot and Joseph Xavier Saintine, which some sources state was based on Walter Scott's novel Old Mortality, while others state that there is no connection. When Bellini arrived in Paris in mid-August 1833, he had intended to stay only about three weeks, the main aim being to continue the negotiations with the Paris Opéra which had begun on his way to London a few months earlier. However, these negotiations came to nothing, but by October he had decided to spend the winter in that city, especially as both Il pirata and I Capuleti e i Montecchi were to be given by the Théâtre-Italien that season. The offer from the Théâtre came in January 1834; he accepted because \"the pay was richer than what I had received in Italy up to then, though only by a little; then because of so magnificent a company; and finally so as to remain in Paris at others' expense.\" Taking from April until its premiere the following January, Bellini had time to ensure that the opera was as close to perfection as possible. After the premiere, Bellini reported to his friend Francesco Florimo in Naples that: It was to be Bellini's final work; he died in September 1835 at the age of 33."

One of the first western-style operas was The White Haired Girl (1940). Chinese-language western-style opera is to be distinguished the Revolutionary operas of the Cultural Revolution such as Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy which were mainly an adaption of Peking opera with socialist text and subjects, with some influence from Soviet musical theatre. The 1950s-70s saw several patriotic socialist operas, such as Red Guards on Honghu Lake (1956). Modern operas with a continuation of \"realist\" socialist elements include A Village Teacher (2009). China has several separate geju companies under the Ministry of Culture, parallel with the traditional Chinese opera companies. The most prestigious are the Beijing-based central geju-yuan China National Opera House troupe (CNOH), and the Shanghai-based Shanghai Opera House company. In each case the term \"Opera House,\" geju-yuan, refers to the institute or company, not to a fixed building or theatre. The street addresses of both companies are merely administrative offices and rehearsal rooms. Other notable geju companies around China include the Liaoning geju yuan, based in Shenyang and others. The status of geju has been boosted by availability of new world-class venues such as the China's National Centre for the Performing Arts in Beijing (\"The Big Egg\" on Tiananmen Square East) and the new Shanghai Grand Theatre. Since its opening in 2009 CHNCPA has staged operas such as Xi Shi and A Village Teacher in 2009, The Chinese Orphan in 2011, and the folk-opera The Ballad of Canal in 2012. The Shanghai Grand Theatre has similarly staged Chinese-language geju of the Shanghai Opera House company along with Italian, French and German-language operas."

      "description": "The Piano Concerto No. 18 in B-flat major, KV. 456 is a concertante work for piano, or pianoforte, and orchestra by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. In Mozart's own catalogue of his works, this concerto is dated 30 September 1784. For years, historical speculation was that Mozart had written this concerto for Maria Theresa von Paradis, based on a letter written around that time by Leopold Mozart to his daughter Nannerl. However, Hermann Ullrich has discounted this theory, based on the date of entry in Mozart's catalogue and the fact that von Paradis had left Paris at the start of October 1784, which indicated that there was not sufficient time to send von Paradis the concerto for performance. Richard Maunder has countered with the idea that Mozart could still have sent the concerto to Paris, and that it would have been forwarded to von Paradis in London, where it was possible that she performed the work in March 1785. The work is orchestrated for solo piano, flute, two oboes, two bassoons, two horns, and strings. The concerto is in three movements: Mozart wrote out two different cadenzas for the first movement. Joseph Swain has performed a Schenkerian analysis of each first-movement cadenza. Martha Kingdon Ward has commented that the slow movement of this concerto contains one of the \"most tranquil\" of Mozart's flute solos, specifically in the G major variation. M.S. Cole has noted Mozart's use of meter changes in the finale, starting at measure 171, from 6/8 to 2/4 in the winds, with the piano following at measure 179. This changing of tempo in rondo finales was contrary to common practice at the time. Joel Galand has performed a Schenkerian analysis of the rondo finale, and noted features such as its novel use of ♭II as a remote key."

The title page stated it to be composed when Wolfgang was 9 years old, i.e. in 1765. However, since Leopold often advertised his son as being younger than his actual age, this date is questionable. Before the discovery, only incipits were known, from the archives of Breitkopf & Härtel and on the third page of the cover for the K. 19 symphony. (This cover had previously served as a cover for this symphony and a Symphony in C, K. 19b, still lost). The symphony had still not been found at the time of K6. The symphony is influenced by Johann Christian Bach. Harold Schoenberg notes that the symphony \"has no individuality\" on account of Mozart's very young age at the time of its composition."

      "description": "The Dream of Gerontius is a poem written by Blessed John Henry Newman (February 21, 1801 – August 11, 1890) consisting of the prayer of a dying man, and angelic and demonic responses. The poem, written after Newman's conversion from Anglicanism to Roman Catholicism, explores his new Catholic-held beliefs of the journey from death through Paradise to God and thence to Purgatory. The poem follows the main character as he nears death and then reawakens as a soul, preparing for judgment, following one of the most important events any human can experience: death. Newman uses the death and judgement of Gerontius as a prism through which the reader is drawn to contemplation of their own fear of death and sense of unworthiness before God. His depiction of the overwhelmed Gerontius in Phase Seven of the poem, who begs to be taken for purgatorial cleansing rather than diminish the perfection of God and his courts of Saints and Angels by his continued presence, has become a popular expression of mans desire for healing through redemptive suffering. This scene of the poem has done much for the rehabilitation of the doctrine of purgatory which had previously come to be seen as a fearful terror rather than a state of final purification essentially positive in nature. Newman said that the poem \"was written by accident – and it was published by accident.\" He wrote it up in fair copy from fifty-two scraps of paper between 17 January and 7 February 1865 and published it in May and June of the same year, in two parts in the Jesuit periodical The Month. The poem inspired a choral work of the same name by Edward Elgar in 1900. Gerontius owes much of its imagery to the Divine Comedy of Dante Alighieri, an allegorical depiction of traveling through the realms of the dead."

The reason for this is that the Acts of the Apostles records an event at Pentecost where the apostles are filled with the Holy Spirit. The experience clearly causes the apostles to behave in an unusual way and in chapter 2 verse 15 the Acts of the Apostles states explicitly that the apostles were not drunk because it was only the third hour of the day (ie 9am). As the Acts of the Apostles was so explicit in linking the Pentecost experience of the Apostles to the third hour of the day, Christian hymns and prayers intended to be used at that time of the day, have traditionally made reference to the coming of the Holy Spirit."

      "description": "L’arbre enchanté, ou Le tuteur dupé (\"The Magic Tree, or, the Tutor Duped\"), Wq 42, is a one-act opéra comique by Christoph Willibald Gluck to a libretto based on the 1752 opéra-comique Le poirier (\"The Peartree\") with a text by Jean-Joseph Vadé[fr]. Vadé's libretto was based on a tale from Boccaccio's Decameron, as retold by Jean de La Fontaine. Gluck's opera was written for the nameday of Emperor Francis Stephan, premiering at the Schönbrunn palace in Vienna on the evening of October 3, 1759, anniversary of the death of Saint Francis of Assisi. Gluck revised the work to a versified adaptation by Pierre-Louis Moline of the original libretto, to which was also added (for Lubin) the ariette \"Pres de l'objet qui m'inflamme\", parodied from Gluck's earlier opera Le cadi dupé. The revised version was first performed on February 27, 1775, as L’arbre enchanté, at the Palace of Versailles. The story is slightly varied in Chaucer's tale of May and Januarie, where it is instead the pair of lovers who climb the tree. The diarist Karl von Zinzendorf related that Gluck sang the part of an ailing singer from the wings in 1761."

      "description": "This is a partial discography of Parsifal, an opera in three acts by Richard Wagner. Parsifal was expressly composed for the stage at Bayreuth and many of the most famous recordings of the opera come from live performances on that stage. In the pre-LP era, Karl Muck conducted excerpts from the opera at Bayreuth which are still considered some of the best performances of the opera on disc (they also contain the only sound evidence of the bells constructed for the work's premiere, which were later melted down by the Nazis during World War II). Hans Knappertsbusch was the conductor most closely associated with Parsifal at Bayreuth in the post-war years, and the performances under his baton in 1951 marked the re-opening of the Bayreuth Festival after the Second World War. These historic performances were recorded in mono sound, originally issued but now no longer available on the Teldec label, and reissued in 2003 on Naxos Historical. Knappertsbusch recorded the opera again for Philips in 1962 in stereo, and this release is often considered to be the classic Parsifal recording.There are also many \"unofficial\" live recordings from Bayreuth, capturing virtually every Parsifal cast ever conducted by Knappertsbusch. Amongst the studio recordings, those by Georg Solti, Herbert von Karajan and Daniel Barenboim (the latter two both conducting the Berlin Philharmonic) have been widely praised. The von Karajan recording was voted \"Record of the Year\" in the 1981 Gramophone Awards. Also highly regarded is a recording of Parsifal under the baton of Rafael Kubelík. Originally recorded for Deutsche Grammophon but never released, it is now available on the Arts Archives label. On the Saturday 14 December 2013 broadcast of BBC 3'S CD Review – Building a Library, music critic David Nice surveyed recordings of Parsifal and recommended the 1980 recording by the Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks, Rafael Kubelik (conductor), as the best available choice."

It was first produced at the Royal Gallery of Illustration, Lower Regent Street, London, under the management of German Reed, opening on 29 March 1869 and closing on 21 November 1869. The work is a domestic farce of mistaken identities and inept disguises, as two men desperately compete to marry a wealthy young lady. One is young and poor, and the other is a rich miser. Each disguises himself as her guardian. No Cards was the first of Gilbert's six pieces for the Gallery of Illustration. It was also Gilbert's first libretto with prose dialogue and the first stage work for which he wrote lyrics to be set to music, rather than lyrics to pre-existing music. No Cards was played on a double bill with Arthur Sullivan and F. C. Burnand's Cox and Box, although Gilbert and Sullivan did not meet until later that year. After a successful 139 performances, the bill toured the British provinces. Gilbert liked German Reed's setting of the Babbetyboobledore song enough to reuse it later in 1879 in his next show, The Pretty Druidess. Music publisher Joseph Williams & Co. reissued \"No Cards\" in 1895 with a score by \"Lionel Elliott\", which appears to be a pseudonym. A production mounted at St. George's Hall in London in 1873 appears to have been the first to use this \"Elliott\" score, and a revival took place at St. George's Hall in 1902. The Royal Victorian Opera Company of Boston, Massachusetts made a video of the piece in 1996 using the Elliott score. The first British revival in over a century is being produced by the Centenary Company at the Greenwich Theatre from 18 to 21 November 2009 (as a curtain raiser to The Pirates of Penzance) using Elliott's score retrieved from the British Library."

Altogether, this was one of eighteen operas which he wrote during the time he spent in Naples. Rossini took melodies from other operas to compose Elisabetta, including the overture, first written for Aureliano in Palmira, which is famous as the overture to The Barber of Seville. As Holden notes, with the re-uses of earlier music, \"it is as if Rossini wished to present himself to the Neapolitan public by offering a selection of the best music from operas unlikely to have been revived in Naples.\" Some of Elisabetta 's music was recycled in later operas and a part of Elisabetta's first aria was re-used by Rossini four months later in Rosina's aria \"Una voce poco fa\" in the opera The Barber of Seville."

According to Stephen Hill, co-founder of a radio show called Hearts of Space, the term is used to describe music that evokes a feeling of contemplative spaciousness. Hill states that space music can range in character, the sonic texture of the music can be simple or complex, it can be instrumental or electronic, it may lack conventional melodic, harmonic, or rhythmic features, and may be less concerned with the formal compositional schemes associated with other styles of music. Hill proposes that space music can be found within a wide range of genres. Some claim[who?] that music from the western classical, world, Celtic, traditional, experimental and other idioms also falls within the definition of space music. Hill believes that space music can evoke a \"continuum of spatial imagery and emotion,\" which can be beneficial for introspection, and for developing, through a practice of deep listening, an awareness of the spatiality of sound phenomenon. This type of psychonautic listening can produce a subtle trance-like state in certain individuals which can in turn lead to sensations of flying, floating, cruising, gliding, or hovering. Hill states that space music is used by some individuals for both background enhancement and foreground listening, often with headphones, to enable states of relaxation, contemplation, inspiration, and generally peaceful expansive moods; it may promote health through relaxation, atmospherics for bodywork therapies, and effectiveness of meditation. Space music appears in many film soundtracks and is commonly played in planetariums. According to Hill space music is an eclectic music produced almost exclusively by independent labels and it occupies a small niche in the marketplace, supported and enjoyed by a relatively small audience of loyal enthusiastic listeners."

Singers will often use the falsetto register. The son Huasteco is particularly noteworthy for its flamboyant and virtuoso violin parts, although the style varies from state to state. Footwork often danced to Son Huasteco is the Zapateado. Improvisation plays a strong role in the style, with musicians creating their own lyrics and arrangements to a standard repertoire.

Bates was given the affectionate name 'Kabbarli', meaning 'grandmotherly person'. The Young Kabbarli has four singing roles (soprano, mezzo-soprano, tenor, bass) and three non-singing roles. It is scored for 2 flutes, 2 clarinets, bassoon, horn, percussion (castanets, wood block, sticks, flints, wooden shaker), piano, viola, and double bass. The Young Kabbarli was premiered in August 1965 at the Festival of Contemporary Opera and Music, at the Theatre Royal in Hobart, as a companion piece to Larry Sitsky's The Fall of the House of Usher. Sitsky's piece was well-received, Sutherland's less so. It received performances by the State Opera of South Australia in Adelaide and in Melbourne in 1972. The Young Kabbarli was recorded in 1973 at Flinders University, Adelaide. It was the first Australian opera recorded in Australia, and it was the first quadraphonic disc made in Australia.

The vaksen-s perform repeating patterns in hocket and often strike their instruments rhythmically with a stick while blowing into them. In the modern day, standard trumpets and saxophones may also be used. The genre though predominantly Afro-based has some Taino Amerindian elements to it such as the use of güiros and maracas. The songs are always performed in Haitian Kreyòl and typically celebrate the African ancestry of the Afro-Haitian masses. Vodou is often implemented through the procession. The genre was imported to the Dominican Republic and is now an integral part of the Afro-Dominican music scene, where it is known colloquially as gagá. In the Dominican Republic, the music is often played by the Afro-Dominican population as a cultural tribute to their African ancestors in the same manner as their counterparts in Haiti. Rara in Haiti is often used for political purposes, with candidates commissioning songs praising them and their campaigns. Rara lyrics also often address difficult issues, such as political oppression or poverty. Consequently, rara groups and other musicians have been banned from performing and even forced into exile—most notably, folk singer Manno Charlemagne who later returned to Haïti and was elected mayor of Port-au-Prince in the 1990s. Rara performances are often performed while marching, and are often accompanied by twirlers employing metal batons. Performances generally begin on Ash Wednesday and culminate at Easter Weekend. \"The Rara festival most likely developed during the period of colonial slavery, when enslaved Africans and Afro-Creoles in the colony of Saint-Domingue were said to parade with drums and instruments on Easter Sunday. There is also some evidence that troupes of maroons marched with drummers, horns, and singers, similarly to Rara.\" Since the 1990s, Haitian Americans have been performing Rara in New York City's Prospect Park in the summer on Sundays."

      "description": "\"Carrickfergus\" is an Irish folk song, named after the town of Carrickfergus in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. The origins of the song are unclear, but it has been traced to an Irish language song, \"Do bhí bean uasal\" (\"There Was a Noblewoman\"), which is attested to the poet Cathal Buí Mac Giolla Ghunna, who died in 1745 in County Clare. The song appears on a ballad sheet in Cork City in the mid nineteenth century in macaronic form. The Irish lyrics were about a man being cuckolded, a bawdy and humorous ditty. By contrast, the English lyrics are nostalgic. With the Industrial Revolution, a linen-trade developed between Co. Antrim (where Carrickfergus is situated), and Co. Cork. It is possible the English lyrics came from snatches picked up in interactions between the Cork men and the Antrim men. Robert Gogan suggests Carrickfergus may have evolved from at least two separate songs which would explain why it does not have a consistent narrative. For example, the Ancient Music of Ireland, published by George Petrie in 1855, contained a song called \"The Young Lady\" which featured many but not all of the lyrics used in Carrickfergus. Gogan also refers to a recording of a song called \"Sweet Maggie Gordon\" which is kept in the Music for the Nation section of the US Library of Congress. It was published by Mrs Pauline Lieder in New York in 1880. It contains verses which are similar to Carrickfergus, but the chorus is closer to another Irish/Scottish folk song called \"Peggy Gordon\". In modern times, \"Carrickfergus\" became known after actor Peter O'Toole related it to Dominic Behan, who put it in print and made a recording in the mid-1960s. The middle verse was allegedly written by Behan. The song has been recorded by many well known performers including Ryan Kelly, Celtic Thunder, Paddy Reilly, Declan Affley, Joan Baez, Bryan Ferry, Dominic Behan, Charlotte Church, The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem, Brian Dunphy, De Dannan, Subway to Sally, Joe Dassin (as Mon village du bout du monde), The Dubliners, Garnet Rogers, Brian Kennedy, Declan Galbraith, Irish Stew of Sindidun, Lisa Kelly, Cedric Smith, with Loreena McKennitt on harp (as Carrighfergus), Órla Fallon, Van Morrison, Bryn Terfel, Van Morrison and the Chieftains, Ronan Keating, Katherine Jenkins and Allison Moorer. It was also adapted in Scooter's song \"Where the Beats...\". The song is a popular request at folk festivals and concerts, and was played at the 1999 funeral of John F. Kennedy, Jr. The song was more recently performed by Loudon Wainwright III over the closing credits of HBO's series Boardwalk Empire. Furthermore, the Russian singer-songwriter Aleksandr Karpov (a.k.a. \"Aleksandr O'Karpov\") translated the lyrics into Russian, recording a Russian version of \"Carrickfergus\", also titled \"За синим морем, за океаном\" (Za sinim morem, za okeanom - \"Beyond the blue sea, beyond the ocean\"). Closely related is the song \"The Water is Wide\", similar tune and very similar lyrics in some lines. Recordings by loads of people including Bob Dylan (Live), Pete Seeger, The Seekers and two former The Byrds, Roger Mcguinn and Chris Hillman, who both did solo versions."

In contrast to older cumbias the lyrics of New Chilean Cumbia deals more with urban life and combines aspects of rock, hip hop and a wide variety of Latin American genres like Andean music, salsa, the son, reggae, boleros, ska, Latin-African music, diablada and even folklore from the Balkans, like the Klezmer, and Gipsy music. While the movement has various influences its roots lie in the Chilean cumbia tradition established by Orquesta Huambaly, Giolito y su Combo, Orquesta Cubanacán, La Sonora Palacios and Sonora de Tommy Rey, but in contrast to these bands the New Chilean Cumbia is aimed towards a younger public. The New Chilean Cumbia public comes often from the middle classes. The movement have been contrasted to the heavily aired and commercialized Chilean Romantic Cumbia whose commercially most successful acts are La Noche and Américo. The New Chilean Cumbia is also distinct from the Argentine Cumbia Villera a genre that enjoys certain popularity in Chile and relyes on synthesizers and focus on marginal shanty town life.

The libretto was written by the composer, with assistance from Vladimir Belsky, Vladimir Stasov, and others. Rimsky-Korsakov was first inspired by the Bylina of Sadko in 1867, when he completed a tone poem on the subject, his Op. 5. After finishing his second revision of this work in 1891, he decided to turn it into a dramatic work. The music is highly evocative, and Rimsky-Korsakov's famed powers of orchestration are abundantly in evidence throughout the score. According to the Soviet critic Boris Asafyev, writing in 1922, Sadko constitutes the summit of Rimsky-Korsakov's craft. From the opus 5 tone poem the composer quoted its most memorable passages, including the opening theme of the swelling sea, and other themes as leitmotives - he himself set out to \"utlize for this opera the material of my symphonic poem, and, in any event, to make use of its motives as leading motives for the opera\"."

It reflected the life of the early Christian martyr Saint Polyeuctus. Regarded by one author as Donizetti's \"most personal opera\" with the music being \"some of the finest Donizetti was to compose\", Poliuto was written in 1838 for performances planned at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples later that year. However, close to the time for rehearsals to begin, King Ferdinand II refused to allow the martyrdom of a Christian saint to be seen on stage and forbade the production. Angry at the decision and with a commission for the Paris Opéra due from the composer, Donizetti paid the penalty to the San Carlo for not producing an original work as a substitute, and left Naples for Paris arriving on 21 October. As his first commission for Paris, he decided to revise Poliuto and between 1839-40 a French text, with the title Les martyrs, was prepared by Eugene Scribe which conformed to the conventions of a French four-act grand opera, but which incorporated 80% of the music from Poliuto. It was presented in Paris on 10 April 1840. When eventually given in Italy, it was initially presented in a translation from the French version under the title of I martiri. It took until 30 November 1848, months after the composer's death, in order for Poliuto to finally appear for six performances at the San Carlo in its original Italian three-act version."

      "description": "Petite symphonie concertante, Op. 54, is an orchestral composition by the Swiss composer Frank Martin, one of his best-known works. Martin received the commission for the work in 1944, though progress was delayed by work on the oratorio In Terra Pax. The Petite symphonie concertante was completed the following year and received its premiere in Zurich on May 27, 1946, under the direction of Paul Sacher, who is also the work's dedicatee. Sacher's commission prompted Martin to assume the unusual ensemble of harp, harpsichord, piano and string orchestra divided into two groups, though all accounts suggest the final choice of instruments was the composer's own. Using all of the common stringed instruments available, Martin desired to use the harp, harpsichord and piano not as accompanying, or 'basso continuo' instruments (as is often their role) but as solos, thus being a distant echo of J.S. Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 5, and justifying the work's title of symphonie concertante. The work gained Martin international recognition. The Petite symphonie concertante is in two movements, separated by the briefest of pauses. Each movement may then be divided into two 'halves', though the relationship between each part differs considerably between the two: the first comprises a slow introduction of forty-six bars out of which the following Allegro derives all of its motivic material; the second begins with an Adagio which showcases the three solo instruments (harp, piano, then harpsichord) before breaking into a lively march. The work is Neoclassical in outlook, and his approach reflects Martin's adoration of Bach. Martin's style draws elements from both the musical styles and traditions of France (such as the use of harmony to create local colour and the freer formal organisation) and Austro-Germany (such as the generally polyphonic style and the dense motivicism). The work also demonstrates Martin's use of the 12-tone technique, though in an entirely different way from the composers of the Second Viennese School. A 12-note row is apparent at the opening of the first movement, though Martin treats it as he does any other thematic or motivic material: it appears in various transpositions (all twelve, if fragmentary statements are included) but is never used in inversion, retrograde or retrograde-inversion forms, and is by no means present throughout the work. The row also demonstrates some other characteristic features of the composer's 12-tone technique, including the use of constant rhythmic values, no octave transpositions within the series, and the row's use frequently as an accompanimental ostinato. Later in the movement however, Martin does demonstrate his own take on the technique, common in the music of Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern and others, of 'telescoping' his row forms, that is, the final note of one statement is also the first of the next at a different transposition, though unlike these composers, Martin only uses fragments of each row form. The piece was intended for the so-called \"revival harpsichord\", the large early-20th-century instruments built in the piano tradition by makers such as Robert Goble and Pleyel. It is one of the few pieces in the sinfonia concertante genre to be composed in the twentieth century."

      "description": "\"Cod Liver Oil\" is a song about a traditional medicinal drink for many Newfoundlanders. Cod liver oil in the traditional way of manufacture was sun cured and served in bottles in its raw form. The song was written by Johnny Burke (1851–1930), a balladeer from St. John's, Newfoundland. It has been recorded by the Irish band The Dubliners and by Newfoundland folk rock Band Great Big Sea on their album The Hard and the Easy. The song is played to the melody of the traditional Irish sean-nós song \"An Lacha Bacach\" (Irish: The Lame Duck), as famously portrayed by Nell Ní Chróinín."

It is actually his tenth symphonic work, as Mahler gave no ordinal number (nor the title 'symphony') to his symphonic song-cycle Das Lied von der Erde.Though the work is often described as being in the key of D major, the tonal scheme of the symphony as a whole is progressive. While the opening movement is in D major, the finale is in D-flat major. A typical performance takes about 75–90 minutes."

Written by guitarist and vocalist James Mercer, it concerns his hometown of Albuquerque, New Mexico and his experiences there in his late twenties. The lyrics are fueled with \"angst and confusion,\" as Mercer was finding himself constantly depressed and disconnected from his friends and scene. The song attracted attention from Sub Pop Records, who issued the song as a single in February 2001. The buzz created by the song led to positive press for the group's debut album, Oh, Inverted World. The song began to be licensed in a variety of media beginning in 2002, including various television programs and a McDonald's advert that aired during the 2002 Winter Olympics. Although the song never charted on any international charts, it became a sensation following its appearance in the film Garden State (2004), where a character referred to it as a song that \"will change your life.\" The band saw increased record sales and notoriety as a result. Critics were very positive in their assessments of \"New Slang\", with many calling it one of the best songs from Oh, Inverted World. The song's music video was directed by Lance Bangs, and features shots filmed in Albuquerque and Portland, Oregon."

The anonymous libretto is based on Orphée by Michel du Boulay, originally set by the French composer Louis Lully. Most of the work is in German but it also contains passages in French and Italian drawn from famous operas by Handel and Jean-Baptiste Lully. The music to these words is Telemann's own, however.

It is representative of what is known as the Ukrainian school of Polish literature. Because of the unclear history of the song, it is sometimes presented as being either, or both, a Polish folk song or Ukrainian folk song. The lyrics vary only slightly between the two languages. The tune was popular among Polish soldiers during the Polish-Soviet War, and was also sung by the Polish Home Army guerrillas during World War II.

      "description": "Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are often associated with masculinity, aggression, and machismo. The first heavy metal bands such as Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple attracted large audiences, though they were often derided by critics, a status common throughout the history of the genre. During the mid-1970s, Judas Priest helped spur the genre's evolution by discarding much of its blues influence; Motörhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed. Beginning in the late 1970s, bands in the New Wave of British Heavy Metal such as Iron Maiden and Saxon followed in a similar vein. Before the end of the decade, heavy metal fans became known as \"metalheads\" or \"headbangers\". During the 1980s, glam metal became a commercial force with groups such as Mötley Crüe and Poison. Underground scenes produced an array of more aggressive styles: thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax, while other extreme subgenres of metal such as death metal and black metal remain subcultural phenomena. Since the mid-1990s popular styles have further expanded the definition of the genre. These include groove metal (with bands such as Pantera) and nu metal (with bands such as Slipknot, Korn and Linkin Park), the latter of which often incorporates elements of grunge and hip hop.",

Olegas Truchanas was instrumental in bringing the beauty of Lake Pedder in Southwest Tasmania to the attention of the Australian and international public in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the lake and its remarkable pink beach being inundated by a dam constructed to produce hydro-electricity. Sung in Lithuanian and English, the opera's themes are resilience and renewal - qualities that enabled Truchanas to rise from deprivation to find an inner strength and clarity, which he needed to do several times during his life. In addition to the loss of Lake Pedder, Truchanas suffered through World War II in Lithuania; several years later he lost his home (and his photographic work) in the devastating 1967 Tasmanian fires. Truchanas drowned in the Gordon River as the flood waters were rising on nearby Lake Pedder. Olegas is a major opera being developed with the support of Truchanas' widow, Melva. In 2007, IHOS Music Theatre and Opera presented excerpts from the work's three acts, the first set in Lithuania, the second in Tasmania up to and including the fires, and the third set in Tasmania during the Pedder campaign.

Comparsas are large ensembles of musicians, singers and dancers with a specific costume and choreography which perform in the street carnivals of Santiago de Cuba and Havana. The instrumentation differs between congas santiagueras and congas habaneras. Congas santiagueras include the corneta china (Chinese cornet), which is an adaptation of the Cantonese suona introduced in Oriente in 1915, and its percussion section comprises bocúes (similar to African ashiko drums), the quinto (highest pitched conga drum), galletas and the pilón, as well as brakes which are struck with metal sticks. Congas habaneras lack the corneta china but include trumpets, trombones and saxophones, and they have a different set of percussion instruments: redoblantes (side drums), bombos (bass drums), quinto, tumbadora (the lowest pitched conga drum), and metallic idiophones such as cowbells, spoons, frying pans and rims. Congas and comparsas have a long history which dates back to the 19th century, with musical traditions being passed down from one generation to the next. The older comparsas are derived from cabildos de nación or other social groups, whereas the later ones, called paseos, are derived from barrios (neighbourhoods). The music of the congas has become a genre itself, being introduced into Cuban popular music in the early 20th century by artists such as Eliseo Grenet and Armando Oréfiche and his Havana Cuban Boys. They have been present for decades in the repertoire of many conjuntos, Cuban big bands and descarga ensembles, also having an influence on modern genres such as salsa and songo. The conga drum, also known in Cuba as tumbadora, took its name from the congas de comparsa."

At the Paris Opéra-Comique it was performed over 300 times throughout the 19th century and up to 1911.

The sonatas stem from a period late in Brahms’s life where he “discovered” the beauty of the sound and tonal colour of the clarinet. The form of the clarinet sonata was largely undeveloped until after the completion of these sonatas, after which the combination of clarinet and piano was more readily used in composers’ new works. These were the last chamber pieces Brahms wrote before his death and are considered two of the great masterpieces in the clarinet repertoire. Brahms also produced an oft-performed transcription of these works for viola with alterations to better suit the instrument."

      "description": "\"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" is an English Christmas carol that enumerates in the manner of a cumulative song a series of increasingly grand gifts given on each of the twelve days of Christmas (the twelve days after Christmas). The song, published in England in 1780 without music as a chant or rhyme, is thought to be French in origin. \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 68. The tunes of collected versions vary. The standard tune now associated with it is derived from a 1909 arrangement of a traditional folk melody by English composer Frederic Austin, who first introduced the now familiar prolongation of the verse \"five gold rings\"."

      "description": "The Miserly Knight, also The Covetous Knight, (Russian: Скупой рыцарь, Skupój rýtsar’) is a Russian opera in one act with music by Sergei Rachmaninoff, with the libretto based on Alexander Pushkin's drama of the same name. It contains roles for five male singers, but no females. The composer decided essentially to set the Pushkin text as written, and had Feodor Chaliapin in mind for the role of the Baron, however, Chaliapin withdrew from the production over artistic differences. The first performance was on 24 January (11 January OS) 1906 at the Bolshoi Theatre, Moscow, with the composer himself conducting, in a double-bill performance with another Rachmaninoff opera written contemporaneously, Francesca da Rimini. The director was Vasiliy Shkafer. Productions of the opera have been rare. In addition, the characterization of the moneylender, who is identified in the story as being Jewish, has been criticized as anti-Semitic."

      "description": "The Universe Symphony is an unfinished work by American classical music composer Charles Ives. The date of composition is unknown, but he probably worked on it periodically between 1911 and 1928. Intended to be a \"spatial\" composition for two or more orchestras, it is in three sections: Ives conceived the idea during the autumn of 1915 while he was staying in the Adirondacks of New York State, but he left it alone until 1923, when he returned to working on it. Although he spent many years on it, many of the sketches are missing. During the 1990s there were three separate performing versions assembled, including a version by David Gray Porter (1993, Section A plus the Coda and part of a first Prelude only), Larry Austin (1994), and Johnny Reinhard (1996). It is a complex work, using 20 independent musical lines; each moves in a separate meter, only coinciding on downbeats eight seconds apart. According to his notes on a sketch of the Universe Symphony, Ives was \"striving to ... paint the creation, the mysterious beginnings of all things known through God and man, to trace with tonal imprints the vastness, the evolution of all life, in nature, of humanity from the great roots of life to the spiritual eternities, from the great inknown to the great unknown.\" Ives envisioned the work being performed by multiple orchestras located in valleys, on hillsides and mountains, with the music mimicking \"the eternal pulse ... the planetary motion of the earth ... the soaring lines of mountains and cliffs ... deep ravines, sharp jagged edges of rock.\"Pages are missing or were never written. The first part (a.k.a. \"Section A\") was derived from a sketch of 1915 for a piece called \"The Earth and the Heavens\" or \"The Earth and the Firmament,\" with one group of instruments representing the Earth and another group representing the Heavens, and with a group of percussion instruments representing the eternal pulse of the universe underlying both. This is the most complete large fragment of the piece, along with a Coda for the complete movement written in a similar style that shares the same four main \"Earth-themes\" of Section A. The main \"sky-theme\" is the only theme built upon a quotation, the hymn tune \"Bethany\" (\"Nearer My God to Thee,\" the same hymn tune used as the basis for the Finale of his Fourth Symphony.) There were also to be three Preludes to the Symphony, but none were completed. The most complete is the first Prelude, but again this was not completed, left only in the form of an outline-sketch with musical examples. For more information see James B. Sinclair's \"Descriptive Catalogue\" of Ives's music and manuscripts (1999). In addition, Reinhard has written a detailed history of Ives's composition of the Universe Symphony as well as his own process in preparing a performance edition from Ives's sketches."

      "description": "We Come to the River – Wir erreichen den Fluss is an opera by Hans Werner Henze to an English-language libretto by Edward Bond. Henze and Bond described this work as \"Actions for music\", rather than an opera. It was Henze's 7th opera, written originally for the The Royal Opera in London, and takes as its focus the horrors of war. The opera was first performed at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London on 12 July 1976, with the composer as producer, Jürgen Henze as director, and David Atherton conducting. It was subsequently staged at the Deutsche Oper Berlin, and received its first American performance at Santa Fe Opera in 1984, conducted by Dennis Russell Davies. The opera is notable for its complex staging, including a large cast of 111 roles covered by over 50 singers, with doubling of roles and three separate instrumental ensembles, including a percussionist who actually performs among the singers on stage. The scholar Robert Hatten has noted the mix of musical styles that Henze has employed, ranging from 'atonal to neoclassically tonal'. Although the subject matter of war would usually indicate a realistic treatment, Henze calls for three separate stages, and urges producers to avoid realism in the costuming. The Emperor's role is written for a mezzo-soprano voice – thus the abstract Emperor becomes the embodiment of evil. The use of typically romantic coloraturas for the role of Rachel is another device to remove a character from realism into abstraction – in this case, the sycophantic nature of Rachel. Despite the vast forces required to perform the work, Henze asks for the utmost simplicity in production values."

He composed the Christmas cantata in Leipzig for Christmas Day and first performed it on 25 December 1725. Bach composed the cantata in his third year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig. He used a text by Georg Christian Lehms, which was published already in 1711. The text has no recitatives alternating with arias, but instead three biblical quotations, opening with verses from Psalm 26, then a verse from the Book of Jeremiah about God's greatness, and finally the angels' song from the Nativity according to the Gospel of Luke. The closing chorale is taken from Caspar Füger's \"Wir Christenleut\". Bach scored the work festively for four vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of trumpets and timpani, transverse flutes, different kinds of oboe, strings and basso continuo including bassoon. He derived the first chorus, in the style of a French overture, from the overture to his forth Orchestral Suite, embedding vocal parts in its fast middle section. The song of the angels is based on the Christmas interpolation Virga Jesse Floruit of his Magnificat in E-flat major, BWV 243a. He chose obbligato instruments to differentiate the character of the three arias: two flutes with the tenor expressing the \"lowly birth\", oboe d'amore with the alto, representing God's love, and trumpet, oboes and strings with the bass for his call to sing songs of joy together. Bach led the Thomanerchor in the first performances on Christmas Day, one in the Nikolaikirche and one in the Thomaskirche."

It was written by George Harrison following the group's attendance at Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's Transcendental Meditation course in India in early 1968. Although Harrison later stated that he was addressing God in the lyrics, it is the first of his compositions that invites interpretation as both a standard love song and a paean to his deity. Harrison wrote \"Long, Long, Long\" during a period that marked his emergence as a prolific songwriter, coinciding with his return to the guitar after two years of studying the Indian sitar. His musical inspiration for the song was \"Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands\" by Bob Dylan, while the understated arrangement reflects the influence of the Band's 1968 album Music from Big Pink. The Beatles recorded the song in London towards the end of the troubled sessions for the White Album. The calm, meditative track ends with a partly improvised segment, which was inspired by the sound of a wine bottle vibrating on a speaker in the recording studio. \"Long, Long, Long\" has received praise from many music critics. Ian MacDonald described it as Harrison's \"touching token of exhausted, relieved reconciliation with God\" and considered it to be his \"finest moment on The Beatles\". Elliott Smith and Jim James are among the other artists who have recorded or performed the song."

Its words were first published by Luke Wadding, a 17th-century Irish bishop, in a work called Small Garland of Pious and Godly Songs (1684). It is unclear whether Wadding wrote the song or was recording an earlier composition. Both the text and the tune to which it is now sung were discovered and written down by Cecil Sharp in Buckland, Gloucestershire and Ralph Vaughan Williams, who heard it being sung by a Harriet Verrall of Monk's Gate, near Horsham, Sussex (hence \"Sussex Carol\"). The tune to which it is generally sung today is the one Vaughan Williams took down from Mrs Verrall and published in 1919. An earlier version using a different tune, and a variation on the first line, On Christmas night true Christians sing, was published as early as 1878 in Henry Ramsden Bramley and John Stainer's Christmas Carols New and Old. The carol has been arranged by a number of composers. Vaughan Williams' setting is found in his Eight Traditional English Carols. Several years earlier, Vaughan Williams had included the carol in his Fantasia on Christmas Carols, first performed at the 1912 Three Choirs Festival at Hereford Cathedral. Erik Routley's arrangement in the 1961 University Carol Book adds a modal inflection to the setting. The carol often appears at the King's College \"Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols\", where it is performed in arrangements by either David Willcocks or Philip Ledger, both former directors of music at the chapel. Willcock's arrangement appears in the first OUP Carols for Choirs."

It was commissioned by the British Council to be played at the 1939 New York World's Fair, along with Arthur Bliss's Piano Concerto in B-flat, and Ralph Vaughan Williams' Five Variants of Dives and Lazarus. It is scored for piccolo, three flutes, two oboes, English horn, three clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, double bassoon, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, bass drum, tenor drum, snare drum, tambourine, cymbals, gong, triangle, glockenspiel, harp and strings. It is in three movements: The movement opens with a melodic motive from the clarinets, and the slower, second main motive is introduced almost immediately after. These two motives form a basis for the first subject, which has a very haunting mood, almost looking back on the opening of the fifth symphony. The lyrical second subject is achingly tender, but does show signs of optimism, particularly when it recapitulates at the end of the movement. The second movement is much more serene, almost a relief after the experience of the stormy opening movement. It is in a three part form, alike a one movement symphony, and the mood is somewhat dignified. It closes peacefully to set up the finale. The last movement is a theme and variations, something that Bax had not attempted before, and he makes good work of the gorgeous theme introduced after quite a blustery introduction, which is used for the variations of the main theme. It closes with Bax's shortest epilogue, almost acting as an end to an extraordinary cycle of symphonies, as if to say \"goodbye\"."

      "description": "\"Happy Birthday to You\", also known more simply as \"Happy Birthday\", is a song that is traditionally sung to celebrate the anniversary of a person's birth. According to the 1998 Guinness World Records, \"Happy Birthday to You\" is the most recognized song in the English language, followed by \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\". The song's base lyrics have been translated into at least 18 languages. The melody of \"Happy Birthday to You\" comes from the song \"Good Morning to All\", which has been attributed to American sisters Patty and Mildred J. Hill in 1893, although the claim that the sisters composed the tune is disputed. Patty Hill was a kindergarten principal in Louisville, Kentucky, developing various teaching methods at what is now the Little Loomhouse; her sister Mildred was a pianist and composer. The sisters used \"Good Morning to All\" as a song that young children would find easy to sing. The combination of melody and lyrics in \"Happy Birthday to You\" first appeared in print in 1912, and probably existed even earlier. None of the early appearances of the \"Happy Birthday to You\" lyrics included credits or copyright notices. The Summy Company registered a copyright in 1935, crediting authors Preston Ware Orem and Mrs. R. R. Forman. In 1988, Warner/Chappell Music purchased the company owning the copyright for US$25 million, with the value of \"Happy Birthday\" estimated at US$5 million. Based on the 1935 copyright registration, Warner claimed that the United States copyright will not expire until 2030, and that unauthorized public performances of the song are technically illegal unless royalties are paid to Warner. In one specific instance in February 2010, these royalties were said to amount to US$700. By one estimate, the song is the highest-earning single song in history, with estimated earnings since its creation of US$50 million. In the European Union, the copyright of the song was set to expire no later than December 31, 2016. The American copyright status of \"Happy Birthday to You\" began to draw more attention with the passage of the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act in 1998. When the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Act in Eldred v. Ashcroft in 2003, Associate Justice Stephen Breyer specifically mentioned \"Happy Birthday to You\" in his dissenting opinion. American law professor Robert Brauneis, who extensively researched the song, concluded in 2010 that \"It is almost certainly no longer under copyright.\" In 2013, based in large part on Brauneis's research, Good Morning to You Productions, a company producing a documentary about \"Good Morning to All\", sued Warner/Chappell for falsely claiming copyright to the song. In September 2015, a federal judge declared that the Warner/Chappell copyright claim was invalid, ruling that the copyright registration applied only to a specific piano arrangement of the song, and not to its lyrics and melody. In February 2016 Warner/Chappell settled for US $14 million and sent the song into the public domain."

      "description": "This musical work, while touted as \"P. D. Q. Bach's Half-Act Opera: The Stoned Guest,\" is actually the work of Peter Schickele. The title is a play on the \"stone guest\" character in Don Giovanni by Mozart, as well as the opera The Stone Guest by Alexander Sergeyevich Dargomïzhsky. The work is a parody of classical opera, although some critics consider it to be the equal of many classical works in technical ability.[citation needed] The opera appears on the 1970 album of the same name. The loose story combines elements of Don Giovanni with elements of Carmen by Georges Bizet. Some character names, such as \"Don Octave\" and \"Donna Ribalda\" play on the Mozart opera, referring to Don Ottavio and Donna Elvira respectively, while the castanet-clicking \"Carmen Ghia\" plays on the title character of Bizet's opera (and puns on the Volkswagen Karmann Ghia). The \"Commendatoreador\" plays on both operas at once, being a combination of \"Il Commendatore\" and the toreador Escamillo. The orchestral accompaniment for Donna Ribalda's opening aria, \"Let's face it—I'm lost\", bears more than a passing resemblance to the \"Rex tremendae majestatis\" from Mozart's Requiem. At one point in the opera, the rival divas Carmen Ghia and Donna Ribalda break character in the middle of a recitative, so the singers can hold a conversation (still in recitative) about their singing careers. At a subsequent point, they have a contest to see who can hold a note the longest. The final scenes of the opera parody first the stereotype (exemplified by Don Giovanni itself) of classical opera as having a tragic ending and then the stereotype of the Romantic narrative (as reflected in, e.g., Goethe's revision of the Faust legend) by revealing the tragic ending to have been a false ending and introducing deus ex machina to generate a happy conclusion not warranted by the earlier plot."

      "description": "Beatrice di Tenda is a tragic opera in two acts by Vincenzo Bellini, from a libretto by Felice Romani, after the play of the same name by Carlo Tedaldi Fores. Initially, a play by Alexandre Dumas was chosen as the subject for the opera, but Bellini had reservations about its suitability. After he and Giuditta Pasta (for whom the opera was to be written) had together seen the ballet based on the very different play, Tedaldi-Fores' Beatrice Tenda, in Milan in October 1832, she became enthusiastic about the subject and the composer set about persuading Romani that this was a good idea. Romani, who had his own concerns, the principal one being the close parallels with the story told in Donizetti's Anna Bolena, an opera which had established that composer's success in 1830. Against his better judgment, he finally agreed, although he failed to provide verses for many months. Although unsuccessful at its premiere in Venice in 1833, Bellini felt that he had counteracted the horror of its story \"by means of the music, colouring it now tremendously and now sadly\". Later, after hearing of the opera's success in Palermo, Bellini wrote to his Neapolitan friend Francesco Florimo, stating that Beatrice \"was not unworthy of her sisters\". Also, it was Pasta's performances in the title role that overcame the public's hostility to the piece. The opera was Bellini's penultimate work, coming between Norma (1831) and I puritani (1835) and it was the only one of his operas to be published in full score in his lifetime."

The libretto was written by René Morax (1873–1963), and tells the biblical story of King David’s life from the time he was a shepherd, to his conquests in battle, his rise to power, his lust for another man’s wife, his agony over his son’s death, his disobedience to God, and finally to his own death. The work is separated into twenty-seven sections or movements and depends heavily on thematic elements. Arthur Honegger was commissioned to write incidental music to accompany Rene Morax’s play Le roi David in 1921. Honegger was given the nearly impossible deadline of 2 months to complete the work and was rewarded with much acclaim at the premiere. In 1923 he combined Morax’s narrative with his music and created a \"symphonic psalm,\" the form that is familiar today, and titled his work Le roi David."

      "description": "The Butterfly Lovers' Violin Concerto (simplified Chinese: 梁祝小提琴协奏曲; traditional Chinese: 梁祝小提琴協奏曲), along with the Yellow River Piano Concerto, is one of the most famous modern works of Chinese music. It is an orchestral adaptation of an ancient legend, the Butterfly Lovers. Written for the western style orchestra, it features a solo violin played using some Chinese techniques. The Butterfly Lovers' Violin Concerto is written in traditional 5-note technique (pentatonic scale), it uses many Chinese melodies, chord structures and patterns. This gives the piece a distinctive \"Chinese\" sound, though it uses tonal harmonies. The Butterfly Lovers' Violin Concerto was written in 1959 by two Chinese composers, He Zhanhao (何占豪, born 1933) and Chen Gang (陈钢, born 1935), while they were students at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music. The music did not attain popularity before the late 1970s, when China loosened its restrictions after the Cultural Revolution. Once released from censorship, it became an embodiment of China in transition. The work is a common feature in figure skating and in concert halls worldwide. This concerto is now often performed with Chinese instruments playing the violin part, the most common being Erhu, Pipa and Liuqin. In such cases the soloist is often accompanied by an orchestra consisting of Chinese instruments. He Zhanhao is more widely credited for the composition of the concerto. However, his main contribution was the famous opening theme while most of the development was in fact written by Chen Gang. This was revealed in an exclusive interview with the latter.[citation needed] The 1959 premiere of the Butterfly Lovers' Violin Concerto featured 18-year violinist Yu Lina and took place in Shanghai as part of the celebration of the 10th anniversary year of the founding of the People's Republic of China. It was first recorded in 1959 with soloist Shen Rong on violin and the Symphony Orchestra of Shanghai Music Conservatory conducted by Fan Cheng-wu."

      "description": "Il ritorno di Tobia (\"The return of Tobias\") is an oratorio composed in 1775 by Joseph Haydn (Hob. XXI:1). The work is the first oratorio the composer wrote and, according to Jones, was \"his most extended and ambitious composition up to that time\". The Italian-language libretto of the work is by Giovanni Gastone Boccherini, brother of the composer Luigi Boccherini. This libretto is harshly criticized by Olleson, who notes that the author de-dramatizes vivid episodes in the source (the story of Tobit in the Apocrypha), depriving Haydn of the opportunity for highly dramatic musical utterance. The work was premiered in Vienna on 2 April 1775, under the sponsorship of the Tonkünstler-Societät, a musician's benevolent society. The musical forces were substantial: Smither writes: \"characteristic of the large forces used for the Tonkünstler-Societät concerts, the orchestra, chorus, and soloists possibly numbered more than 180 performers.\" He adds that the premiere was \"enormously successful.\" In 1784, Haydn substantially revised the work, with cuts to make numbers shorter and new choruses, for another of the Tonkünstler-Societät's benefit concerts. It is thought that at this concert Haydn first met Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who became his good friend. One of the soprano soloists was Nancy Storace, also a friend of Haydn, who later was Mozart's first Susanna in The Marriage of Figaro. In 1808 the oratorio made a third appearance on the program of the Tonkünstler-Societät, this time in a revised version by the now-elderly composer's pupil, Sigismund Neukomm. The performance on the night of 22 December, which required the labors of most of the highly qualified musicians in Vienna, had regrettable consequences for a now-famous rival concert taking place in Vienna on the same evening, the benefit for Ludwig van Beethoven that premiered his Fifth and Sixth Symphonies. Today, Il ritorno di Tobia is eclipsed by Haydn's later works in this genre -- The Creation and The Seasons -- and is seldom performed or recorded."

      "description": "Les pêcheurs de perles (The Pearl Fishers) is an opera in three acts by the French composer Georges Bizet, to a libretto by Eugène Cormon and Michel Carré. It was first performed on 30 September 1863 at the Théâtre Lyrique in Paris, and was given 18 performances in its initial run. Set in ancient times on the island of Ceylon, the opera tells the story of how two men's vow of eternal friendship is threatened by their love for the same woman, whose own dilemma is the conflict between secular love and her sacred oath as a priestess. The friendship duet \"Au fond du temple saint\", generally known as \"The Pearl Fishers Duet\", is one of the best-known numbers in Western opera. At the time of the premiere, Bizet (born on 25 October, 1838) was not yet 25 years old: he had yet to establish himself in the Parisian musical world. The commission to write Les pêcheurs arose from his standing as a former winner of the prestigious Prix de Rome. Despite a good reception by the public, press reactions to the work were generally hostile and dismissive, although other composers, notably Hector Berlioz, found considerable merit in the music. The opera was not revived in Bizet's lifetime, but from 1886 onwards it was performed with some regularity in Europe and North America, and from the mid-20th century has entered the repertory of opera houses worldwide. Because the autograph score was lost, post-1886 productions were based on amended versions of the score that contained significant departures from the original. Since the 1970s, efforts have been made to reconstruct the score in accordance with Bizet's intentions. Modern critical opinion has been kinder than that of Bizet's day. Commentators describe the quality of the music as uneven and at times unoriginal, but acknowledge the opera as a work of promise in which Bizet's gifts for melody and evocative instrumentation are clearly evident. They have identified clear foreshadowings of the composer's genius which would culminate, 10 years later, in Carmen. Since 1950 the work has been recorded on numerous occasions, in both the revised and original versions."

      "description": "Violin Sonata No. 32 in B-flat major (K. 454) was composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in Vienna on April 21, 1784. It was published by Christoph Torricella in a group of three sonatas (together with the piano sonatas K. 284 and K. 333). The sonata was written for a violin virtuoso Regina Strinasacchi of Mantua to be performed by them together at a concert in the Kärntnerthor Theater in Vienna on April 29, 1784. Although Mozart had the piano part securely in his head, he did not give himself enough time to write it out, and thus it was performed with a sheet of blank music paper in front of him in order to fool the audience. According to a story told by his widow Constanze Mozart, the Emperor Joseph II saw the empty sheet music through his opera glasses and sent for the composer with his manuscript during which time Mozart had to confess the truth, although that is likely to have amused the monarch rather than cause his irritation. The work consists of three movements: The sonata opens with an exceptionally slow introduction, in which emphasis is put on the equality of the two instruments, kept throughout the entire work. The second movement has a melodic feeling of adagio, which was the tempo written down by Mozart at first, but then crossed out and marked Andante. In the development section there are bold chromatic modulations. The final movement returns to the playful mood of the first, but even so happens to be a very sophisticated Rondo."

      "description": "Skweee is a musical style, with origin in Sweden and Finland. Skweee combines simple synth/chiptune leads and basslines with funk, R&B or soul-like rhythms, overall rendering a stripped-down funky sound. The tracks are mostly entirely instrumental, though there are exceptions. The name Skweee was coined by Daniel Savio, one of the originators of the emerging sound. The name refers to the use of vintage synthesizers in the production process, where the aim is to \"squeeze out\" the most interesting sounds possible. The current producers are both newcomers and old, experienced producers from the Scandinavian electro and electronica environment. Skweeelicious, a blog dedicated to skweee, and community sites such as MySpace and Nation of Skweee have played a major role in the distribution of skweee music and public exposure of the genre. The major outlets of skweee music are the Swedish record label Flogsta Danshall and Finnish record label Harmönia. Norwegian Dødpop, Canadian Ancient Robot, US Losonofono, US Titched, US Poisonous Gases, Spanish Lo Fi Funk, Finnish Mässy, and French Mazout have since been added to this family. The preferred media format of skweee enthusiasts is the 7\" vinyl record. Early releases were exclusively released in this format. More recently, however, a series of 12\" vinyl records, digital releases and CD compilations have been released through these outlets as well. The increasing notability of the skweee genre has resulted in releases such as the Eero Johannes album on Planet Mu and the Skweee Tooth compilation on Ramp Recordings.",

      "description": "Il pesceballo, (The Fish-Ball) is a 19th-century American pasticcio opera in one act featuring the music of Bellini, Donizetti, Mozart, and Rossini, with a spoof Italian libretto by Francis James Child which makes use of some of grand opera's most popular melodies. The recitatives and chorus parts were written by John Knowles Paine, and James Russell Lowell translated the libretto into English. Child was a Harvard English professor and opera lover, and the text was originally inspired by an incident which occurred to a colleague of his. One evening George Martin Lane was trying to make his way to Cambridge, MA, from Boston. He discovered that he had only 25 cents, which was not enough for both supper and the fare needed to get to Cambridge. As he was very tired and hungry, he stopped at a local diner and asked for half of a serving of macaroni. After he had recounted the story to his friends, he wrote a comic ballad, called the Lay of the One Fishball. A fishball was a fried New England concoction made of potatoes and fish stock, and usually eaten for breakfast. The ballad became very popular with Harvard students, and inspired Child's opera; it also became the source for the popular Tin Pan Alley song, \"One Meat Ball\". The opera begins with a chorus sung to the tune of \"La dolce aurora\" from Rossini's Mosè in Egitto. The song of the Stranger in the second scene is adapted to the \"Serenade\" in The Barber of Seville; the song of the Padrona in the fourth scene is set to the \"Non piu mesta\" of La Cenerentola; the duet in the fifth scene to \"La dove prende Amor recetto\" of the Magic Flute; the \"Cavatina\" in the sixth scene to the \"Di pescator\" of Lucrezia Borgia; the aria of the seventh scene, to the \"Madamina\" of Don Giovanni; the chorus of scene eight to the \"Guerra, Guerra\" of Norma; the duet of scene nine to the \"O sole piu ratto\" of Lucia di Lammermoor; the \"Cavatina\" of scene ten to the \"Meco all'altar\" of Norma; the chorus of the same scene to the \"Bando, Bando\" of Lucrezia Borgia, and the trio which follows, to the \"Guai se tu sfoggi\" of the same opera; the piece concludes with the aria to \"Vieni!\", from Donizetti's La favorite."

Handel started it soon after the opera season at King's Theatre was cancelled for lack of subscribers. The oratorio was not well received by the first audience though commended in the Daily Post, and the second performance was shortened, the mainly choral work now augmented with Italian- style arias. The first version of the piece is in three parts rather than two, the first part more famous as \"The ways of Zion do mourn\", with altered text as \"The sons of Israel do mourn\" lamenting the death of Joseph.

      "description": "The Sonata for Viola and Piano, Op. 147 is the last composition by Dmitri Shostakovich. Completed in July 1975, just weeks before his death, it is dedicated to Fyodor Druzhinin, violist in the Beethoven Quartet.The work received its official premiere in October 1975 with the performing forces of violist Fyodor Druzhinin and pianist Mikhail Muntyan. Appearing at the end of the composer's compositional output, the Sonata for Viola and Piano effectively represents the bleak, mortality-obsessed late style composition of Shostakovich. The work unfolds in three movements, following a relatively straightforward tempo scheme of slow-fast-slow. The first movement, Andante, begins with a sparse pizzicato figure in the viola, accompanied by an equally stark piano line, followed by an explosive and wrenching middle section, and closing with a remembrance of the movement’s opening. The second movement, Allegretto, is characterized by sharp contrasting of dry, pointed figures with smooth, connected passages; the primary material of the movement was borrowed directly from Shostakovich’s unfinished opera The Gamblers (1942), granting the movement a vocal and dramatic quality. The final movement of the sonata carries a substantial portion of the work’s emotional weight. Shostakovich gave the Adagio movement an unofficial subtitle: Adagio in the memory of a great composer or Adagio in the memory of Beethoven. The most explicit connection to Beethoven is Shostakovich's quotation of Beethoven’s Piano Sonata No. 14 in C-sharp minor, Op. 27, No. 2 (1801). Throughout the movement, glimpses of the Beethoven sonata appear (mostly as the famous rhythmic pattern of the ‘Moonlight’ sonata), juxtaposed with the reappearance of themes and motives presented earlier within the viola sonata. This method of quotation and allusion is a characteristic feature of Shostakovich’s late-style period (1969–1975). The finale of Mendelssohn's early Viola Sonata (1824) also quotes from the ‘Moonlight’ Sonata, indicating Shostakovich may have studied this work in preparation for his own. Shostakovich’s Sonata for Viola and Piano represents relatively little innovation in his compositional style. The sonata simply exists as a prime exemplar of his late-style period in its austere texture, usage of pre-existing material, and elegiac quality."

Despite serious initial problems with the Austrian censors who had control over northern Italian theatres at the time, the opera had a triumphant premiere at La Fenice in Venice on 11 March 1851. It is considered by many to be the first of the operatic masterpieces of Verdi's middle-to-late career. Its tragic story revolves around the licentious Duke of Mantua, his hunch-backed court jester Rigoletto and Rigoletto's beautiful daughter Gilda. The opera's original title, La maledizione (The Curse), refers to the curse placed on both the Duke and Rigoletto by a courtier whose daughter had been seduced by the Duke with Rigoletto's encouragement. The curse comes to fruition when Gilda likewise falls in love with the Duke and eventually sacrifices her life to save him from the assassins hired by her father."

      "description": "I vespri siciliani ([i ˈvɛːspri sitʃiˈljaːni]; The Sicilian Vespers) is a five-act Italian opera originally written in French for the Paris Opéra by the Italian romantic composer Giuseppe Verdi and translated into Italian shortly after its premiere in June 1855. Under its original title, Les vêpres siciliennes, the libretto was prepared by Eugène Scribe and Charles Duveyrier from their work Le duc d'Albe, which was written in 1838 and offered to Halévy and Donizetti before Verdi agreed to set it to music in 1854. The story is loosely based on a historical event, the Sicilian Vespers of 1282, using material drawn from the medieval Sicilian tract Lu rebellamentu di Sichilia. After its June 1855 Paris premiere, an Italian libretto was quickly prepared using a new title because Verdi realized that it would have been impossible to place the story in Sicily. Based on Scribe's suggestions for changing the location, it became Portugal in 1640 while under Spanish control. This version was first performed at the Teatro Regio in Parma on 26 December 1855."

Couperin's Leçons de ténèbres use the Latin text of the Old Testament Book of Lamentations, in which Jeremiah deplores the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians. In the Catholic tradition, they symbolize the loneliness of Christ, betrayed by Judas and abandoned by his apostles.[citation needed] Musical settings of the Lamentations of Jeremiah the Prophet were common in the Renaissance, famous polyphonic examples being those by Thomas Tallis, Tomás Luis de Victoria, Lassus, and Carlo Gesualdo. Leçons de ténèbres were a particular French subgenre of this music with other similar settings being composed by Marc-Antoine Charpentier, Michel Delalande and others. Those by Couperin are for two high vocalists and basso continuo. They are composed of three lessons (two other sets of three for Thursday and Friday having been lost). Each Latin verse is preceded by a melisma on the first letter of the Hebrew text. The first two were composed for one single voice, while the third was written for two voices. This last Leçon, where the two voices perform superb appogiatura, ornaments, dissonances and vocalizing, is considered as one of the undisputed peaks of baroque vocal music. A 1954 recording of these works serves as the theme music for the 1968 film Phèdre, featuring Marie Bell. The recording, conducted by Laurence Boulay, was released on the French label Erato."

The concerto was written when Barber was still serving in the army but at a point of time when he was granted time and freedom to compose. Hence the piece was composed in and named after the house \"Capricorn\" in Mt. Kisko, New York, acquired by Barber and Gian Carlo Menotti in 1943 and so-named for the maximum sunshine it got during the winter (, 239). It is therefore \"a nostalgic piece that expresses Barber’s desire to return to a situation where he could compose without the constant interruption of military requirements\", and was the last piece Barber wrote before his discharge from military duty (, 23, 135). The work was composed for Daniel Saidenberg but it is not certain whether or not it was also under the aegis of the Office of War Information—the army unit to which Barber was assigned (, 160)."

It is usually attributed to the 11th century Wipo of Burgundy, chaplain to the German Emperor Conrad II, but has also been attributed to Notker Balbulus, Robert II of France, and Adam of St. Victor. Victimae Paschali Laudes is one of only four medieval sequences that were preserved in the Missale Romanum published in 1570 after the Council of Trent (1545-63). The three others were the \"Veni Sancte Spiritus\" for the feast of Pentecost, \"Lauda Sion\" for Corpus Christi, and the \"Dies Irae\" for the Requiem Mass (a fifth sequence, the \"Stabat Mater\" for the Feast of the Seven Dolours of the Blessed Virgin Mary, was added to the missal by Pope Benedict XIII in 1727). Before Trent, many other feasts also had their own sequences, and some 16 different sequences for Easter were in use. Victimae Paschali Laudes is one of the few sequences that are still in liturgical use today. Its text was set to different music by many Renaissance and Baroque composers, including Busnois, Josquin, Lassus, Willaert, Hans Buchner, Palestrina, Byrd, Perosi, and Fernando de las Infantas. Chorales derived from Victimae Paschali Laudes include \"Christ ist erstanden\" (12th century) and Martin Luther's \"Christ lag in Todes Banden\". The section beginning \"Credendum est,\" with its pejorative reference to the Jews, was deleted in the 1570 missal, which also replaced \"praecedet suos (his own)\" with \"praecedet vos (you)\", and added \"Amen\" and \"Alleluia\" to the end."

Its name is derived from the words dhruva and pad (verse), where a part of the poem (dhruv) is used as a refrain. The term may denote both the verse form of the poetry and the style in which it is sung. Abul Fazl, courtier and chronicler at the court of the Emperor Akbar, defines the dhrupad verse form in his Ain-e-Akbari as \"four rhyming lines, each of indefinite prosodic length.\" Thematic matter ranges from the religious and spiritual (mostly in praise of Hindu deities) to royal panegyrics, musicology and romance. Though Dhrupad is basically a vocal tradition, its musical aesthetics have been adopted by many instrumentalists. Not only by various schools of Rudra Veena players (Beenkars) but also by other instrumentalists, who look to Dhrupad for examples for their instrumental developments of raag, and go as far as to adapt the format: a slow, unmetered alaapa, Jhor, Jhala, to be concluded with one or more compositions in contrasting talas. Ram Narayan and Hariprasad Chaurasia, to name but two acclaimed instrumentalists, pay homage to Dhrupad in the way they present a raag.",

The drama takes place during the heroine's last minutes on the stake, with flashbacks to her younger days and her trial. Honegger entitled his work a dramatic oratorio, adding speaking roles and actors. The work has an important part for the ondes Martenot, an early electronic instrument (played at the premiere by its inventor Maurice Martenot). Claudel's dramatic frame provided Honegger with a space – between heaven and earth, past and present – where he could mix styles from the popular to the sublime. A hybrid work: partly oratorio and partly opera, Honegger uses all his musical means, monody, harmony and counterpoint to build towards sculpted blocks of sound."

It is among the longest operas commonly performed, usually taking around four and a half hours. It was first performed at the Königliches Hof- und National-Theater, today the home of the Bavarian State Opera, in Munich, on 21 June 1868. The conductor at the premiere was Hans von Bülow. The story is set in Nuremberg in the mid-16th century. At the time, Nuremberg was a free imperial city and one of the centers of the Renaissance in Northern Europe. The story revolves around the city's guild of Meistersinger (Master Singers), an association of amateur poets and musicians who were primarily master craftsmen of various trades. The master singers had developed a craftsmanlike approach to music-making, with an intricate system of rules for composing and performing songs. The work draws much of its atmosphere from its depiction of the Nuremberg of the era and the traditions of the master-singer guild. One of the main characters, the cobbler-poet Hans Sachs, is based on a historical figure, Hans Sachs (1494–1576), the most famous of the master singers. Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg occupies a unique place in Wagner's oeuvre. It is the only comedy among his mature operas (he had come to reject his early Das Liebesverbot), and is also unusual amongst his works in being set in a historically well-defined time and place rather than in a mythical or legendary setting. It is the only mature Wagner opera based on an entirely original story, devised by Wagner himself, and in which no supernatural or magical powers or events are in evidence. It incorporates many of the operatic conventions that Wagner had railed against in his essays on the theory of opera: rhymed verse, arias, choruses, a quintet, and even a ballet."

One of the earliest operatic versions of Shakespeare's play, Salieri's Falstaff is notable for a general compression and streamlining of the original plot, note the absence of the two young lovers, Fenton and Anne, and the addition of a scene in which Mistress Ford pretends to be German to charm Falstaff (actually two such scenes exist, one in a separate score by Salieri was probably omitted from the original Viennese productions). Defranceschi moves the plot and structure away from Elizabethan drama and closer to the standard conventions of late 18th century opera buffa. Highlights include the Sinfonia (overture) in the style of contra dances. The entire opera shows the influence of Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro, which was being successfully revived at the time. Among the musical highlights, besides the sinfonia, are Falstaff's strutting Act I patter aria, the quartet in Act I, the duettino \"La stessa, La stessissima\", the technically brilliant \"laughter\" trio in the opening moments of Act II, the canonical duet of Mr. and Mrs. Ford toward the end of Act II (featuring a rare late 18th century cello solo) and the grand finale to Act II. Throughout the score Salieri employs careful tone painting, parody of opera seria conventions, a more harmonically interesting structure for the secco recitative, and more involved counterpoint; traits that have helped return Falstaff to the playing boards."

As a further testament to Brahms' affinity for Beethoven, the Piano Sonata is infused with the instantly recognizable motive from Beethoven's Fifth Symphony during the first, third, and fourth movements.[citation needed] Composed in Düsseldorf, it marks the end of his cycle of three sonatas, and was presented to Robert Schumann in November of that year; it was the last work that Brahms submitted to Schumann for commentary. Brahms was barely 20 years old at its composition. The piece is dedicated to Countess Ida von Hohenthal of Leipzig.

La pravità castigata was originally performed during Lent of 1730 in the opera theater of Franz Anton von Sporck in Prague, then revived with new music by Eustachio Bambini in Brno in 1734. Unfortunately, the Brno performance was regarded as the original production for decades, and a published transcription of the libretto (which is missing two scenes from the Prague production) identifies it incorrectly as an anonymous text first performed in Brno."

The strophe of \"Sacris solemniis\" that begins with the words \"Panis angelicus\" (bread of angels) has often been set to music separately from the rest of the hymn. Most famously, in 1872 César Franck set this strophe for tenor voice, harp, cello, and organ, and incorporated it into his Messe à trois voix, Op. 12. Other hymns for Corpus Christi by Saint Thomas where sections have been separately set to music are \"Verbum supernum prodiens\" (the last two strophes begin with \"O salutaris Hostia\") and \"Pange lingua gloriosi\" (the last two strophes begin with \"Tantum ergo\")."

      "description": "Tecnocumbia is a style of Cumbia where there is a fusion between electronic sounds generated by electronic musical instruments through electronic drums, the electric guitar, and . The \"Tecnocumbia\" was a word developed in Mexico to describe this type of music. However, the style of music was developed throughout South America with different names given to it before the name \"Tecnocumbia\" was adopted as the single denomynation for the music. In Mexico, it developed as a variant of the Mexican cumbia that started in the early 80s. The style added electronic instruments along with samplers to the Mexican cumbia music. One of the first musical groups with electrical 80's sounds was Super Show de los Vazkez from Veracruz, México, formed in 1981, also, other important exponents were Los Temerarios, Los Bukis, Fito Olivares, among others. These groups created several hits with electrical sounds, their fame continues to the end of the 80's. In the early 90s, Selena the \"Tex-mex queen,\" had great musical hits in U.S. and Mexico, her main hits of the tecnocumbia style was \"Como la flor\" (Like a flower), \"Carcacha\" (the old car), and, for first time, this genre was called like \"Technocumbia\" by her, with the musical hit of same name, \"Technocumbia\". In South America, where the Colombian Cumbia most easily expanded in popularity, different \"modern\" styles of the original Colombian rhythm were started mainly in the countries of Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia. The Peruvian cumbia, developed in the early 60s, used electric guitars and synthesisers along with the other classical instruments of the Colombian cumbia in order to create a kind of tropical sound. Variations within the Peruvian cumbia added more tropical rhythms along with a more Andean flavor, which eventually resulted in the creation of the Andean cumbia (Commonly called \"Chicha music\" in Peru). Using the Andean cumbia as a base, in the middle of the 90s the Tecnocumbia sprung up in Peru and since then has gone through many changes in Peru and Bolivia. Rossy War was the most important singer of the Peruvian tecnocumbia, she recorded several hits for Peru and Mexico, but her fame was bigger in the U.S.A's Latin community. Finally in the north of Argentina the most recent exponents are the group Kasualidad and Lagrimas.In Ecuador, this style of music began in 1992 with Grupo Coctel and; later, in 1999 with Sharon la hechicera and Widinson. They are considered the beginners of this music in Ecuador. After them male and female groups appeared like Tierra Canela, Magia Latina, Las Chicas Dulces, Deseo, Kandela y Son, Yerba Buena, Milenium, Batahola and others singers like Jazmin, Jaime Enrique Aymara, Hipatia Balseca, Sanyi, Mayra Alvarado, Milena, Enrique Augusto, Manolo and Silvana. Nowadays the most important singers of tecnocumbia are Maria de los Angeles, Gerardo Morán, Patty Ray, Omayra, Veronica Bolaños, Katty Egas and Delfin Quishpe. En Chile similar style is known as Sound or Música Tropical. The Mexican and South American tecnocumbias have similar styles and rhythms, due to them both having the Colombia cumbia as a base, but they developed through different methods independent of each other and do not sound exactly alike."

      "description": "The Missa de Beata Virgine is a musical setting of the Ordinary of the Mass, by Renaissance composer Josquin des Prez. A late work, probably composed or assembled around 1510, it was the most popular of his masses in the 16th century. The Missa de Beata Virgine is unusual among Josquin's masses in that the first two movements are for four voices, and the last three for five, with the fifth voice derived canonically. Like most musical settings of the mass Ordinary, it is in five sections, or movements: It uses different plainsong chants for each movement, and is a paraphrase mass, one in which the original chants are elaborated, broken up, passed between voices, or sung in different voices simultaneously. The mass is one of only four that Josquin based on plainsong, and probably the second to last (the others are the Missa Gaudeamus, a relatively early work, the Missa Ave maris stella, and the Missa Pange lingua; all of them involve, in some way, glorification of the Virgin Mary). All of the chants in the Missa de Beata Virgine are in praise of the Virgin Mary, and the whole is a Lady Mass, the Votive Mass for Saturday, a type that was popular around 1500. Since music for two of the movements – the Gloria and Credo – appeared independently in Vatican sources, circulating in 1503 or before, it has been presumed that the mass was assembled later from several parts, and most likely the five-voice portions were composed around 1510. The first appearance of the whole mass was in Ottaviano Petrucci's 1514 book of Josquin's masses, his third such set; it has even been speculated that Petrucci himself may have put it together from an existing performance tradition. Most likely Josquin took the Gloria and Credo which he had already written, and then wrote a Kyrie to conform to the Gloria, and added a Sanctus and Agnus to go with the Credo, since the work's modal coherence suggests that he conceived at least the first two movements, and then the last three movements together. The Missa de Beata Virgine was one of Josquin's last three masses, with the others being the Missa Sine nomine and the Missa Pange lingua. It was probably the earliest of the three, and Missa Pange lingua the last. Distinguishing the last masses, and his late style period in general, was a general simplification and refinement: Josquin left behind the elaborate contrapuntal artifice evident in the masses of the preceding period, such as the two he wrote on the L'homme armé tune, and wrote music in which bringing out the meaning of the text, and having it understood, was more important than any virtuoso display. The movements differ in their treatment of the source plainchant. The Kyrie has the chant in all voices, imitatively and paraphrased; the Gloria treats the chant as a cantus firmus, migrating it from voice to voice. Tonally, both movements end on G, and most of their cadences are on G or D. The Credo, the first movement for five voices, ends with a surprising Phrygian cadence on E, and uses canonic techniques more prominently than in the preceding movements. The overall sound is darker and reminiscent of Johannes Ockeghem. The Sanctus is unusual among Josquin's mass movements, for the five voices sing throughout without a break: normally Josquin breaks up the texture with passages in reduced scoring. Yet the texture is light, with the voices singing polyphonically only some of the time. In the closing Agnus, the chant is treated freely, and the texture is similar to that which Josquin used in his chansons. Both the Agnus and Sanctus cadence on C. The popularity of this mass in the 16th century may be due to its \"sensuously appealing\" surface texture, one which foreshadows the music of later composers such as Cristóbal Morales and Nicolas Gombert."

      "description": "Quiet storm is a radio format, musical style, and subgenre of R&B, pioneered in the mid 1970s by then-intern Melvin Lindsey at Washington, D.C. radio station WHUR-FM, featuring soulful slow jams. Smokey Robinson's like-titled hit single, \"A Quiet Storm\", released in 1975 as the title track to his third solo album, lent its name to the format and to the radio program that introduced it to the public. Encompassing a mix of African-American music genres, quiet storm music is distinguished by understated, mellow dynamics and relaxed tempos and rhythms. It can be soothingly pensive, or express romantic sentiment. Quiet storm music is similar to soft rock styles, but it is more closely and unmistakably rooted in R&B and soul music, often with jazz extensions. Today, quiet storm is a broad term given to an array of mellow, slow-groove contemporary R&B, soul and smooth jazz offerings of the type featured on Melvin Lindsey's WHUR program, and on myriad other stations that followed his lead—most notably KBLX-FM in San Francisco, which in 1979 became the first radio station in the U.S. to present a 24-hour quiet storm format (which lasted 32 years, until the station was acquired in April 2011 by Entercom Broadcasting and converted to straight-ahead Urban AC format)."

Rather, it is defined by a direct engagement with LGBT culture in elements such as the lyrical themes or the artist's visual identity and presentation. Artists who have been labelled as part of the genre have, however, varied in their acceptance of the terminology. Some have supported the identification of a distinct phenomenon of \"LGBT hip hop\" as an important tool for promoting LGBT visibility in popular music, while others have criticized it for essentially ghettoizing their music as a limited \"niche\" interest.",

The Gods, among them demi-god Bacchus, appear in human form in ancient India to attempt to persuade the people away from the pervading Buddhist influence. Ariane has followed them, convinced that Bacchus is in fact Theseus, her unrequited love. In the end, Ariane sacrifices herself to save humanity and in doing so, Bacchus becomes a God. Although not a proper sequel, as Ariane dies in both pieces, Bacchus is a companion to Massenet's earlier opera, Ariane. Of Massenet's twenty-five operas, Bacchus is probably the least known, without a modern performance history or single modern recording of even an excerpt. The story of this opera is also related to that of Ariadne auf Naxos from Richard Strauss."

It was very popular throughout the 19th century—its popularity was sufficient for two quotations to appear in Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, and for Lewis Carroll to refer to it in his poem Melancholetta."

      "description": "The Vicar of Bray is a comic opera by Edward Solomon with a libretto by Sydney Grundy which opened at the Globe Theatre, in London, on 22 July 1882, for a run of only 69 performances. The public was not amused at a clergyman's being made the subject of ridicule, and the opera was regarded by some as scandalous. An 1892 revival at the Savoy Theatre was more successful, lasting for 143 performances, after public perceptions had changed. The opera is based on the character described in a satirical 18th-century English folk song \"The Vicar of Bray\", as well as on The History of Sandford and Merton, a series of 18th century moral tales. In the parlour song, the eponymous vicar was the clergyman of the parish of Bray-on-Thames, Berkshire. The most familiar version of the lyrics recounts his adaptability (some would say amorality) over half a century, from the reigns of Charles II to George I. Over this period he embraced whichever form of liturgy, Protestant or Catholic, that was favoured by the monarch of the day to retain his position as vicar of Bray. See the annotated lyrics to \"The Vicar of Bray\". The earliest version of the song's lyrics may have been written by \"an officer in Colonel Fuller's regiment,\" according to one source. The lyrics exist in various forms. However, the story of the vicar's cheerful reversals of principle remains the same in all circumstances. In the opera, the vicar switches between \"High\" and \"Low\" Church, that is, from ritualistic Anglo-Catholic ceremonies to austere evangelical forms of worship."

It finds mention in one hymn of the Ṛgveda (RV 10.121), known as the Hiraṇyagarbha Sūkta, suggesting a single creator deity (verse 8: yo deveṣv ādhi devā eka āsīt, Griffith: \"He is the God of gods, and none beside him.\"), identified in the hymn as Prajāpati. The concept of the \"golden womb\" is again mentioned in the Vishvakarman Sūkta (RV 10.82). The Upanishad calls it the Soul of the Universe or Brahman, and elaborates that Hiraṇyagarbha floated around in emptiness and the darkness of the non-existence for about a year, and then broke into two halves which formed the Svarga and the Pṛthvi. In classical Purāṇic Hinduism, Hiraṇyagarbha is a name of Brahmā, so called because he was born from a golden egg (Manu Smṛti 1.9), while the Mahābhārata calls it the Manifest. Some classical yoga traditions consider Hiraṇyagarbha as the originator of yoga, though this may also be a name for Rishi Kapila."

An early manuscript from Vienna attributes the work to Wolfgang, but nineteenth century copies of the score attribute it respectively to Leopold Mozart and to Carl Dittersdorf. Neal Zaslaw writes: \"A comparison of the results of two stylistic analyses of the work's first movement with analyses of unquestionably genuine first movements of the period by the three composers suggests that Wolfgang is the most likely of the three to have been the composer of K73q\". The symphony is in three movements, lacking a minuet and trio. Kenyon opines that there is \"little special\" about the work, while Zaslaw finds a \"Gluckish ambience\", and some affinity with opera buffa in the repeated triplets found in the Finale."

It was intended that the music was to be set to an existing libretto, La figlia dell'aria by an unknown author. Scholar Charles Osborne notes that \"Rossini had been contracted to write it for performance in London\", during the 1824 season although the London Morning Chronicle of 15 December notes that \"he was to write two Operas during the season\". No completed opera was ever forthcoming. In addition, the composer was engaged to oversee a season of eight of his operas, while Colbran was engaged to sing in Zelmira and Ricciardo e Zoraide. But when Rossini failed to produce even one opera for the season, due as much to the couple's very hectic social life as anything else, a new contract was drawn up with Benelli noting that the opera was intended to be \"commenced and in part finished\" by 1 January 1825. Leaving behind the \"preliminary workings and a bond for £400 with Benelli's bankers\" (as surety for its completion), Rossini and Colbran left England on 25 July 1824, never to return."

Shaabi literally means 'music of the people'. It originated in Cairo in the 1970s, as a new form of urban music expressing the difficulties and frustrations of modern Egyptian life. Shaabi lyrics can be both intensely political, and filled with humour and double entendre. Because of its nature as street music, and a widespread indifference to copyright law among Egyptians, Shaabi today is mainly distributed on pirated tapes and CDs. The first shaabi singer to rise to stardom was Ahmed Adaweyah, whose first album in 1972 sold a million copies. Like many shaabi singers, Adaweyah was famed for his mawwal. More recently, Shaaban Abdel Rahim rose to fame in 2000 with the controversial 'Ana Bakra Israel' ('I hate Israel'), and has remained something of a working-class hero due to a string of populist political hits. Other well-known singers in the shaabi genre include Saad al-Soghayer, Amina, and Abdelbaset Hamouda. Another notable singer is Hakim, who is from a middle-class background unlike most shaabi singers, and whose commercially successful brand of shaabi-pop is generally cheerful and apolitical."

Its title derives from Modest Mussorgsky's work Rayok. It ridicules the Zhdanov decree of 1948 and the anti-formalism campaign in Soviet arts which followed it, and includes quotations from speeches by Zhdanov and a quotation from \"Suliko\" (Joseph Stalin's favourite song). The date of the work is uncertain: according to the composer's friend Isaak Glikman and the Shostakovich family, it was begun in 1948, with further revisions in 1957 and the late 1960s. Another friend, Lev Lebedinsky, claims that the whole work dates from 1957 and that he rather than Shostakovich wrote the libretto. This latter date seems more likely, especially taking into account how dangerous a work like that – even one that is not intended to be published or performed – could be for a composer's own safety. During the composer's lifetime, the work was performed only for family and close friends. It did not receive its first public performance until 12 January 1989 under Mstislav Rostropovich."

Un giorno was given its premiere performance at the Teatro alla Scala, Milan on 5 September 1840. After the success of his first opera, Oberto in 1839, Verdi received a commission from La Scala impresario Merelli to write three more operas. Un giorno was first of the three, but he wrote the piece during a period when first his children and then his wife died and its failure in 1840 caused the young composer to almost abandon opera. It was not until he was enticed to write the music for the existing libretto of what became Nabucco that Verdi restarted his career."

Bach composed the cantata years after the complete cantata cycles from the beginning of his tenure as Thomaskantor in Leipzig in 1723. The text by Picander appeared in a 1728 collection of texts for all occasions of the liturgical year. The feast day also celebrated the circumcision and naming of Jesus. Picander focused on the naming, beginning with a psalm verse mentioning God's name. He used for the conclusion the second stanza from Johannes Hermann's hymn \"Jesu, nun sei gepreiset\". Bach structured the cantata in six movements, an opening choral fugue, alternating arias and recitatives and closing chorale. He scored the work for four vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a festive Baroque instrumental ensemble of three trumpets and timpani, two oboes, strings and continuo. The oboes and strings play with the voices in motet style in the choral sections, while the trumpets add the style of a new time."

The German libretto was by Paul Knepler and Béla Jenbach.Lehár composed the work as a vehicle for Richard Tauber, the acclaimed Austrian tenor, though he assumed the role (with Vera Schwarz as the princess) in Berlin on 30 January 1926, rather than the Vienna premiere which was at the Johann Strauss Theater on 30 October 1925 with Carl Clewing in the title role. Tauber's contract with the Berlin State Opera required him to be in Stockholm at the time of the Vienna premiere. The operetta was so coolly received in Vienna that the Berlin impresario, Heinz Saltenberg, was reluctant to mount it at the Deutsches Künstlertheater without guarantees against losses. In the event, Tauber and Schwarz made it a huge success in Berlin, where it ran for three months. It was the first Lehár operetta specially written for Tauber, who had previously appeared in the composer's Zigeunerliebe in 1920 and Frasquita in 1922 with great success. A new production was mounted in Berlin at the Theater des Westens in April 1930, again with Tauber and Schwarz, and the composer conducting. An English version with lyrics by AP Herbert was presented by C. B. Cochran at the Lyceum Theatre in London in May 1937, with Tauber as Paganini and Evelyn Laye as Anna Elisa. They recorded several numbers from the show for Parlophone Records. In 1934 the operetta was adapted into the German film Paganini."

      "description": "Gamelan semar pegulingan is an old variety of the Balinese gamelan. Dating back from around the 17th century, the style is sweeter and more reserved than the more popular and progressive Gamelan Gong Kebyar. Semar pegulingan is derived from the ancient flute ensemble gamelan gambuh which utilizes a 7 tone scale. Semar pegulingan also uses the 7 tone scale which enables several pathet (similar to modes or scales) to be played. Semar is the name of the Hindu God of love and pegulingan means roughly 'laying down'. It was originally played near the sleeping chambers of the palace to lull the king and his concubines to sleep. The ensemble includes suling, various small percussion instruments similar to sleigh bells and finger cymbals, and trompong - a row of small kettle gongs that play the melody. A similar type of ensemble, Gamelan Pelegongan, substitutes a pair of gendérs for the trompong as the melody carrier and plays the music for a set of dances known as legong.In mediaeval Bali (circa 1700-1906) gamelan semar pegulingan was an important part of the Balinese courts. Accompanying court rituals and pendet dances at temple ceremonies, Semar pegulingan also served to lull the royal family to sleep when it played in the late evenings in the inner sanctum of the palace. There are very few of these gamelan left in Bali. This orchestra is used primarily for instrumental pieces, as the dance repertoire is long since forgotten. The orchestra includes saron jongkok, a gentorag bell-tree, gumanak tube chimes and a kempyung–all features of court gamelan."

The libretto was written by Ernst Rosmer (pen name of Else Bernstein-Porges), adapted from her play of the same name. In 1894, Heinrich Porges asked Humperdinck to write incidental music for his daughter Else's play. Humperdinck was interested in making the story into an opera but since Else Bernstein-Porges initially refused, he opted for the play to be staged as a melodrama – that is with spoken dialog taking place along with an instrumental backdrop. (The work also included operatic arias and choruses, as well as unaccompanied dialog.) In the melodramatic passages, Humperdinck designed an innovative hybrid notation that called for a text delivery somewhere between singing and speech. With this notation, the singer was expected to deliver a substantial portion of the text with approximate pitched melodies. This version was first staged at the Munich Hoftheater, with Hedwig Schako as the goose girl, on 23 January 1897 and enjoyed some success. However, Else Bernstein-Porges finally relented in 1907 and agreed that Humperdinck could transform the work into an opera."

The apolytikion summarizes the feast being celebrated that day. It is chanted at Vespers, Matins and the Divine Liturgy; and it is read at each of the Little Hours. The name derives from the fact that it is chanted for the first time before the dismissal (Greek: apolysis) of Vespers. In the Orthodox Church, the liturgical day begins at sunset, so Vespers is the first service of the day. The term apolyikion is used in Greek tradition. In Slavic tradition the term troparion is specifically used to stand for Apolytikion,whilst troparion is of more generic usage in Greek tradition. The apolytikion could be compared in the Western liturgy to the collect or post-communion, inasmuch as it changes for each feast-day of the year and specifically commemorates the subject of the feast."

      "description": "Saibara (催馬楽) is a genre of accompanied vocal Japanese court music that existed during the Tang period in the Nara and Kyoto regions. It draws from traditional folk music (fūzokuuta (風俗歌)) of the Nara period accompanied by togaku instruments, with the exception of the uchimono (打物 percussion instruments), which are replaced by shakubyoshi (笏拍子), wooden sticks used for rhythm. It may have developed out of music to drive horses along, as the Chinese characters that compose its name seem to indicate but, according to German musicologist Eta Harich-Schneider, there are several other theories. Song texts are short and simple in character and describe scenes of life. The repertoire was once estimated at some 400 songs. In the late Nara period the aristocracy became more interested in complex foreign musical imports. Emperor Horikawa (1079-1107), despite the taste for Chinese culture since the Nara period, also cultivated an interest in fūzokuuta. Courtiers sang saibara songs for entertainment. A fashionable aristocrat was not regarded à jour if he did not know of the latest Chinese imports, such as toka music. In the 14th century, because of the many wars, the repertoire of saibara declined, as many were lost due to the turmoil, and it was only at the crowning ceremony (Daijōe (大嘗会)) of emperor Emperor Go-Mizunoo, who ruled from 1611 to 1629, at Nijo Palace that a reconstruction of the old saibara pieces was attempted and the famous saibara piece \"Ise no umi\" was performed at the Imperial palace in Kyōto. The emperor's wife, Fujiwara no Fusahi, tells in her court chronicles how little old material could be found. The repertoire today includes newly created folk songs imayōuta (今様歌 modern-style song)."

It is one of the 8 or even 10 different styles of samba music, which also include, the following subgenres: Choosing a samba-enredo is a long and tedious process. Before the Carnaval parade itself (February or March), a determined samba school holds contests for writing the song. The song is written by samba composers from the school itself, (\"Ala dos Compositores\") or sometimes from outside composers, normally in \"parcerias\" (partnerships). Each school receives many, sometimes hundreds of songs, hoping to be the next samba-enredo for that year. The samba-enredo is written by these numerous composers mentioned above ONLY after the Carnival Art Director, or \"Carnavalesco\" officially publishes the Samba school parade theme synopsis. After a careful explanation of the parade-theme, many times done by the Carnival Art Director himself, composers may ask questions in order to clarify the synopsis, so they could start writing the samba-enredos. They select the song by process of elimination and usually end up somewhere between five and ten songs. Around this time, the \"finalist samba-enredos\" are played with music and are voted on by the leaders of the samba school and the carnavalesco-the director of the school for Carnaval. After months of deliberation, the new samba-enredo is chosen and becomes the voice of the samba school for Carnaval. The samba-enredo must be well sung by the samba school's puxador (or singer) or the school will lose points for the scoring and judging for the Carnaval competition. The most important night in this process, is called the \"final de samba\", or samba final, when the samba school decided normally between 2 or 3 samba-enredos. While the puxador sings, everyone marching in the Carnaval parade must sing along with him. Harmony is crucial when singing the samba-enredo. This process normally happens in Brazil from August until November, and today is highly professionalized, with samba-composers hiring fans, producing CDs, banners, and parties to promote their samba-enredo. At the end of the process, there is obviously one samba-enredo song, and that´s what the samba school sings during its formal presentation at the Sambadrome. Important to note that the samba-enredo is one of the criteria used by the Judging committee to decide who is the winner of that specific carnival championship."

The play recounts his story in flashbacks as Brutus makes his way through the jungle in an attempt to escape former subjects who have rebelled against him. The play is one of O'Neil's major experimental works, mixing expressionism and realism, and the use of an unreliable narrator and multiple points of view. It was also an oblique commentary on the U.S. occupation of Haiti after bloody rebellions there, an act of imperialism that was much condemned in O'Neill's radical political circles in New York. It draws on O'Neill's own hallucinatory experience hacking through the jungle while prospecting for gold in Honduras in 1909. It was O'Neill's first big box-office hit, and the one that established him as a successful playwright, after he won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for his first play, also in 1920, the much less well-known Beyond the Horizon.

Strauss' publisher, Fritz Simrock, suggested the title Kaiser-Walzer since the title could allude to either monarch, and thus satisfy the vanity of both rulers. The waltz was first performed in Berlin on 21 October 1889. The original cover of the piano edition bore the illustration of the Austrian Imperial Crown. A quiet march starts the waltz's introduction before a sweeping crescendo heralds the gentle principal melody of the first waltz. As more waltz sections are introduced, the mood remains constantly upbeat and triumphant. A cello solo near the end of the work reprises the melody of the first waltz section, before a trumpet fanfare ushers the end of the work, complete with a drumroll on the timpani and a strong brass flourish."

Many think \"Chimes of Liberty\" is a re-working of the Liberty Bell (march) by John Philip Sousa; however, although the influence of Sousa on Goldman is unquestionable, the two marches are totally different, being written by different composers, each with a different tone. Nonetheless (like Sousa's \"Liberty Bell\") Goldman's \"Chimes of Liberty\" does use chimes. It follows the regular march pattern: IAABBCDCDC. This march was written prior to 1922, when Goldman recorded it for the Victor Talking Machine Company, but he revised it at least once before publishing the 1937 edition now largely in use. \"Chimes of Liberty\" is considered one of the most lively and tuneful marches ever written, and possibly America's greatest march not by Sousa after \"National Emblem\" by Edwin Eugene Bagley. It doesn't sound right without the chimes, but the piccolo is equally important. The piccolo solo is more distinctive than the piccolo part of any other march with exception of \"The Stars and Stripes Forever\" by Sousa."

      "description": "The Zoo is a one-act comic opera, with music by Arthur Sullivan and a libretto by B. C. Stephenson, writing under the pen name of Bolton Rowe. It premiered on 5 June 1875 at the St. James's Theatre in London (as an afterpiece to W. S. Gilbert's Tom Cobb), concluding its run five weeks later, on 9 July 1875, at the Haymarket Theatre. There were brief revivals in late 1875, and again in 1879, before the opera was shelved. The farcical story concerns two pairs of lovers. First, a nobleman, who goes to the zoo to woo the girl who sells snacks there. He tries to impress her by buying and eating all of the food. The other couple is a young chemist who believes that he has poisoned his beloved by mixing up her father's prescription with peppermint that he had meant for her. The score was not published in Sullivan's lifetime, and it lay dormant until Terence Rees purchased the composer's autograph at auction in 1966 and arranged for publication. The opera is in one act without spoken dialogue, running about 40 minutes. Like Trial by Jury and Cox and Box, it has been staged as a curtain-raiser to the shorter Gilbert and Sullivan operas. Triple-bills of Sullivan's three one-act operas have also proved successful."

      "description": "Circus music (also known as carnival music) is any sort of music that is played to accompany a circus, and also music written that emulates its general style. Popular music would also often get arranged for the circus band, as well as waltzes, foxtrots and other dances. Although circuses have been in existence since the time of the ancient Romans, circus music first started as a performance by a fiddler or a flutist. It was not until the twentieth century that circus music was performed by big bands. The first modern circus director and performer was Philip Astley (1742-1814), a veteran of the Seven Year's War and a skilled equestrian. With his horsemanship skills and the addition of jugglers, acrobats, and clowns, Astley opened Paris' first circus in 1782. The first known composer of Circus music was Charles Dibdin (1745 - 1814). He was partners with Mr. Astley and was also the one who financed the theatre used for the royal circus. Dibdin was a very well known composer in his time and had written hundreds of works before he decided to join Astley to work for the circus. He wrote all of the pieces used in the circus which were mostly intermezzos or comedy pieces. An ensemble of approximately sixty children was used as singers and dancers to perform the many pieces that he wrote for the circus, such as “The Graces,” and “Clump and Cudden,” and “Pandora,” which was arguably the most famous piece that was used in the circus because it was originally used in a popular puppet show that mocked contemporary figures of the time. The most common type of circus music is the circus march, or screamer. It is characterized by a rapid-fire tempo - usually around 200 beats per minute - and melodies that contain showy features such as leaps, runs, and fanfares. It is difficult for \"windjammers\" (circus musicians) to play because of its fast tempo. Marches served many purposes throughout the course of a circus performance. They were often used for grand entrances and exits, overtures and finales, acts featuring wild animals, or other daredevil-type acts. Circus marches are divided into \"strains\": The galop is another popular form of circus music. Like the march, it is played at a fast, lively tempo and is primarily used for daredevil acts, such as trick-riding or other wild animal performances. Any performance or act that consisted of fast-paced tricks or stunts would probably have performed to a galop. The galop is typically written in 2/4 time and has a short length, but would only end when the ringmaster signaled the end of an act. If the act went longer, the galop could be extended by playing Da capo. Circus music catered to the needs of the different acts. For example, a high-flying, nimble trapeze act could be characterized by a dizzying galop or a graceful waltz. An act containing ferocious wild animals, such as lions, would probably use a march. One of the most recognized pieces of circus music is Entrance of the Gladiators by Julius Fučík 1872 - 1916). Fučík wrote almost 300 marches and dances, and for that reason he is often referred to as “Bohemian Sousa.” Although his most well known piece is now famous in circus music, he did not compose with the intent of having his pieces played in a circus. Another very famous piece of circus music that is very recognizable is \"Barnum and Bailey's Favorite\" by Karl King (1892 - 1971). Unlike Fučík, King grew up performing circus music joining Robinson's Famous Circus at the age of 19 as a baritone player. During that time circus music needed its own style because modern music did not fit with most of the acts that the circus performed. This led to his quick rise in popularity as a circus music composer for circuses everywhere. Also, \"Sobre las Olas\", or \"Over the Waves\", is a popular waltz used during trapeze shows. Mistakenly thought to be a waltz by Strauss, it was written by Mexican composer Juventino Rosas. Many other composers were well known for writing screamers, among them Fred Jewell and Henry Fillmore. One piece, however, that was never normally played was John Philip Sousa's \"Stars and Stripes Forever\". Instead, it was used in emergencies, such as animals getting loose, to help signify to workers that something was wrong. Music that imitates or evokes the sound of the circus has also been written, often showing up in film scores, some dedicated to the subject and some not. Jerry Goldsmith famously wrote a theme for the movie Gremlins in such a style, which influenced the film makers to an extent. Other bands and musicians who employ circus music in their work include Danny Elfman, Tom Waits, Mr. Bungle, the Dickies, Legendary Shack Shakers and Kaizers Orchestra. The music genre Dark Cabaret is heavily based on elements from circus music and from burlesque and vaudeville influences . Popular artists within the genre include The Tiger Lillies and Circus Contraption. Punk Cabaret is also influenced from circus music. Artists include The Dresden Dolls, Amanda Palmer, Emilie Autumn."

      "description": "\"Old Dan Tucker\", also known as \"Ole Dan Tucker\", \"Dan Tucker\", and other variants, is a popular American song. Its origins remain obscure; the tune may have come from oral tradition, and the words may have been written by songwriter and performer Dan Emmett. The blackface troupe the Virginia Minstrels popularized \"Old Dan Tucker\" in 1843, and it quickly became a minstrel hit, behind only \"Miss Lucy Long\" and \"Mary Blane\" in popularity during the antebellum period. \"Old Dan Tucker\" entered the folk vernacular around the same time. Today it is a bluegrass and country music standard. It is no. 390 in the Roud Folk Song Index. The first sheet music edition of \"Old Dan Tucker\", published in 1843, is a song of boasts and nonsense in the vein of previous minstrel hits such as \"Jump Jim Crow\" and \"Gumbo Chaff\". In exaggerated Black Vernacular English, the lyrics tell of Dan Tucker's exploits in a strange town, where he fights, gets drunk, overeats, and breaks other social taboos. Minstrel troupes freely added and removed verses, and folk singers have since added hundreds more. Parodies and political versions are also known. The song falls into the idiom of previous minstrel music, relying on rhythm and text declamation as its primary motivation. Its melody is simple and the harmony little developed. Nevertheless, contemporary critics found the song more pleasant than previous minstrel fare. Musicologist Dale Cockrell argues that the song represents a transition between early minstrel music and the more European-style songs of minstrelsy's later years."

Semiology refers specifically to the study of the neumes as found in the earliest fully notated manuscripts of Gregorian Chant, the oldest of which have been dated to the 9th century. The first application of the term 'semiology' (which first appeared in the 1960s) for the study of Latin chant was made by Dom Eugene Cardine (1905–1988), a monk of the Abbey of Solesmes. In this context, 'semiology' is understood as 'the study of musical signs'. Text and neumatic notation, together with significative letters adjoined to the neumes, presents an effective and integrated mnemonic for the rhythmical interpretation and the melody. While Gregorian palaeography offers a description of the various neumes and their rhythmical and melodic values, Gregorian semiology explains their meaning for practical interpretation."

The opera was premiered on a small lake outside Toronto in 1981 by New Music Concerts and again in 1985 for the Banff School of Fine Arts summer festival on a more remote lake in Banff National Park. The performance was attended by over five thousand people. Other performances occurred at Haliburton Forest and Wildlife Reserve, Ontario in September 1997 and August/September 2007. The Princess of the Stars, which has some basis in Native American mythology, begins about one hour before dawn; timing is coordinated with early morning events such as birds beginning to sing and the sunrise. The audience members are situated in a clearing at the water's edge. The conductor, chorus, instrumentalists and the Princess herself are hidden from view around the edges of the lake. Other main characters and dancers appear in canoes on the lake. The work begins with a seven-minute aria from the unseen Princess (a high Soprano). The aria makes use of echoes across the lake. As this aria ends canoes bearing dancers (The Dawn Birds) and actors in brightly colored costumes begin to appear from the far side of the lake. The characters of Wolf, Three-horned Enemy and Sun God are large, 7 to 10 foot high, lavishly decorated puppets mounted on long war canoes. Actors hidden within the puppets speak, sing or sprechstimme the characters' parts. (Sun God's entrance is timed with the real sunrise.) Throughout the work Schafer has written detailed instructions for the performers. All the canoe routes are scripted and the participants chant in fictional languages created by Schafer. The Princess of the Stars is the Prologue in a series of twelve theatre pieces entitled Patria (Latin for homeland)."

Burleigh completed the last of his several influential arrangements, the song had become very popular in recitals. It has been called \"perhaps the best known and best-loved spiritual\". It has been sung in several films, including the 1929 film version of Show Boat, and by Chevy Chase in the 1983 blockbuster hit National Lampoon's Vacation. The melody was also adapted into the popular song \"Dear Old Southland\", in 1921. Actor and singer Paul Robeson performed \"Deep River\" accompanied by a large male chorus in the 1940 movie The Proud Valley. \"Deep River\" is one of the five spirituals included in the oratorio A Child of Our Time, first performed in 1944, by the classical composer Michael Tippett (1905–98).

The opera's narrative is the collaborative invention of Shoptaw and Sawyer, freely imagined within the framework of the documented historical event and adapted plot of the original comedy.

The topic is derived from the prescribed readings for the Sunday from the Book of Revelation, Michael fighting the dragon. The libretto was written by Picander and published in a 1728/29 volume of cantata texts. He included as the first movement two verses from Psalm 118 and as the closing chorale the third stanza of Martin Schalling's hymn \"Herzlich lieb hab ich dich, o Herr\". The text focuses on the guardian angels, which the chorale mentions specifically for the situation of death. Bach structured the work in seven movements and scored it festively with four vocal parts and a Baroque orchestra of three trumpets, timpani, three oboes, bassoon, strings and continuo. He derived the opening chorus from his Hunting Cantata, composed already in 1713."

      "description": "The Symphony No. 1 by Robert Simpson was completed in 1951 and submitted as his doctorate thesis for the University of Durham. It is scored with a fairly standard orchestra with the exception that high D trumpets are used instead of the standard B-flat or C trumpets. The work is in three connected movements, all in one basic pulse so that tempo changes are all proportionally related. The work pits the tonalities of A and E flat against each other. It begins with a fanfare-like introduction from the brass and which then resides for several moments into a quieter section dominated by the strings which develops the main motives. The second part is half the basic pulse of the opening and is almost completely diatonic, again dominated mostly by strings and introducing a theme which was metamorphosed from the opening section. It is very peaceful, and evokes timeless purity in which its restrained melancholy conveys a meditative atmosphere. Both themes of the opening are combined to form a Part 3 which acts like a finale. The piece ends triumphantly in A major. \"The impression created is of a monolithic unity as though conceived in a single breath.\" The premiere was played by the Danish State Radio Orchestra under Launy Grøndahl in Copenhagen on 11 June 1953 and it was recorded by HMV under the auspices of the British Council in 1956, with the London Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Sir Adrian Boult."

Handel also referred to the work as 'The Story of Semele'.The work is classified as a 'musical drama', but it does fuse elements of opera, oratorio and classical drama, which anticipates the grand operas of the nineteenth century. However, to explain: it is not classed as an oratorio because that term is used for works based on sacred or religious texts - Semele has a secular text. Neither is it opera due to the large number of choruses (there are 10 in Semele; whereas 2 or 3 would be typical of a Handel opera). These chorus are in oratorio anthem style. Likewise, unlike opera, several incidents rely for their impact on the audience's imagination (rather than by direct portrayal), notably Semele's death and insinuations of her sexual relationship with Jupiter."

The piece was written in 1942 while Britten was at sea, going from the United States to England. The piece was written at the same time as Britten's Hymn to St. Cecilia and is stylistically very similar. Originally conceived as a series of unrelated songs, it was later unified into one piece with the framing processional and recessional chant in unison based on the Gregorian antiphon \"Hodie Christus natus est\", heard at the beginning and the end. A harp solo based on the chant, along with a few other motifs from \"Wolcum Yole\", also serves to unify the composition. In addition the movements \"This Little Babe\" and \"Deo Gracias\" have the choir reflecting harp-like effects by employing a canon at the first in stretto."

The work proved to be a complete failure, ending its run on 1 January 1804 after only seven performances. The subject matter, a love affair of the Ancient Greek poet Anacreon, was completely alien to the spirit of the time. One critic complained that in his protagonist Cherubini had represented \"un vieux debauché déguisé en héros d'opéra\" (\"an old debauchee disguised as an opera hero\"). The overture was praised by Weber and Berlioz and has frequently been recorded.

Sweney (1837–1899). The hymn concludes with the chorus: The hymn derives from the King James Version of Isaiah 62:4; \"Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate; but thou shalt be called Hephzibah and thy land Beulah; for the LORD delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married.\" The verse is in reference to the return of the Hebrew from their exile in Babylon in which the Hebrew shall no longer be called Forsaken, but Hephzibah (My Delight Is in Her), and Jerusalem shall no longer be called Desolate, but Beulah (Married). This implies that the Hebrews have turned back to the worship of God. The idea the hymn presents that Heaven can be seen from Beulah land comes from John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress in which he states \"Therefore it is, I say, that the Enchanted ground is placed so nigh to the land Beulah and so near the end of their race [i.e. Heaven].\""

The French libretto was written by Hector Crémieux and Ludovic Halévy. Plays, including melodramas, set in Venice were quite common in Paris in the early 19th century; the libretto, by the successful team from Orphée aux enfers, also nods towards the operas La reine de Chypre (1841) and Haydée (1847). Gänzl describes the piece as being in Offenbach's \"best bouffe manner\", noting a \"long list of sparkling and funny musical pieces\": the multiple serenade beneath Catarina's balcony, the tale of the loss of the Venetian fleet, the parody of an operatic mad scene for Catarina, and a farcical \"quatuor des poignards\".

      "description": "The Te Deum (also known as Ambrosian Hymn or A Song of the Church) is an early Christian hymn of praise. The title is taken from its opening Latin words, Te Deum laudamus, rendered as \"Thee, O God, we praise\". The hymn remains in regular use in the Catholic Church in the Office of Readings found in the Liturgy of the Hours, and in thanksgiving to God for a special blessing such as the election of a pope, the consecration of a bishop, the canonization of a saint, a religious profession, the publication of a treaty of peace, a royal coronation, etc. It is sung either after Mass or the Divine Office or as a separate religious ceremony. The hymn also remains in use in the Anglican Communion and some Lutheran Churches in similar settings. In the traditional office, the Te Deum is sung at the end of Matins on all days when the Gloria is said at Mass; those days are all Sundays outside Advent, Septuagesima, Lent, and Passiontide; on all feasts (except the Triduum) and on all ferias during Eastertide. Before the 1962 reforms, neither the Gloria nor the Te Deum were said on the feast of the Holy Innocents, unless it fell on Sunday, as they were martyred before the death of Christ and therefore could not immediately attain the beatific vision. A plenary indulgence is granted, under the usual conditions, to those who recite it in public on New Year's Eve. In the Liturgy of the Hours of Pope Paul VI, the Te Deum is sung at the end of the Office of Readings on all Sundays except those of Lent, on all solemnities, on the octaves of Easter and Christmas, and on all feasts. It is also used together with the standard canticles in Morning Prayer as prescribed in the Anglican Book of Common Prayer, in Matins for Lutherans, and is retained by many churches of the Reformed tradition."

He composed it in Köthen between 1717 and 1723 for Quinquagesima Sunday and performed it as an audition piece for the position of Thomaskantor in Leipzig on 7 February 1723. The Sunday was the last occasion for music at church before the quiet time of Lent. Bach had at least the first three movements ready for the audition in Leipzig and may have added the substantial last movement, derived from the lost Weimarer Passion, rather late. The cantata deals with healing the blind near Jericho. An anonymous author stayed close to the gospel, having the blind man call Jesus in the first movement, and begging Jesus not to pass in the second. In the last movement Bach presents an extended version of \"Christe, du Lamm Gottes\", the German Agnus Dei of the Lutheran mass. He scored the cantata for three vocal soloists, a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble with oboes, strings and continuo. Bach possibly led the audition performance of the work in Leipzig in the Thomaskirche on 7 February 1723, probably after the sermon. He performed the cantata again for the same occasion on 20 February 1724, this time reinforcing the voices by a brass choir in the final movement."

Genealogical charts or family trees of musical genres show how new genres have emerged from existing genres and how multiple genres have contributed to a new genre. Since music can be endlessly broken down into smaller and smaller categories, a genealogical chart will usually focus on one major genre and its different strains. For instance, jazz is considered to be a genre with many subgenres, including New Orleans jazz, ragtime, swing, bebop, free jazz, and Latin jazz. How these developed out of one another is shown in a genealogical chart, often with major figures or innovators of each subgenre. A genealogy of genres may also incorporate several major genres, such as jazz, rock and roll and folk music. The image accompanying this article shows how numerous Cuban musical styles have developed out of many other genres including some from Europe, Africa, the US, Latin America and other Caribbean countries. While focusing on Cuban music, the image also shows the genealogy of many popular music genres since the 18th century.

Written in 2/4 time, the danzón is a slow, formal partner dance, requiring set footwork around syncopated beats, and incorporating elegant pauses while the couples stand listening to virtuoso instrumental passages, as characteristically played by a charanga or tipica ensemble. The danzón evolved from the Cuban contradanza, or habanera (literally, 'Havana-dance'). The contradanza, which had English and French roots in the country dance and contredanse, was probably introduced in Cuba by the Spanish, who ruled the island for almost four centuries (1511–1898), contributing many thousands of immigrants. It may also have been partially seeded during the short-lived British occupation of Havana in 1762, and Haitian refugees fleeing the island's revolution of 1791–1804 brought the French-Haitian kontradans, contributing their own Creole syncopation. In Cuba, the dances of European origin acquired new stylistic features derived from African rhythm and dance to produce a genuine fusion of European and African influences. African musical traits in the danzón include complex instrumental cross-rhythms, expressed in staggered cinquillo and tresillo patterns. By 1879, the year Miguel Failde's Las alturas de Simpson was first performed (in Matanzas), danzón had emerged as a distinct genre. Danzón went on to interact with 20th-century Cuban genres such as son, and through the danzón-mambo it was instrumental in the development of mambo and cha-cha-chá."

The opera was commissioned by the Houston Grand Opera, which premiered it on April 24, 1981, in a production directed by Harold Prince and conducted by John DeMain. The original production was dedicated to the American radio journalist Lowell Thomas. Floyd made cuts to the score for a television presentation of the opera, and the edited version was shown on US public television in September 1981. The opera was remounted in 2007 by the Louisiana State University Opera. The composer visited the university and advised on the production. The production was recorded and released on DVD, by Newport Classic. The work generated some small controversy among music critics, as it draws upon elements of Broadway musical theater more than Floyd's other more traditionally operatic works. The involvement of Broadway director Harold Prince in the initial production contributed to the emphasis of these elements of the work. In the years since its premiere, this sort of blurring of boundaries between opera and Broadway musicals has become commonplace."

The libretto was based in part on Felice Romani's libretto for Giovanni Pacini's opera Il falegname di Livonia, which had just been presented at La Scala in Milan on 12 April 1819. Another source was Alexandre Duval's comedy Le menuisier de Livonie, ou Les illustres voyageurs (1805).Donizetti's Il falegname di Livonia was premiered on 26 December 1819 at the opening of the 1819-1820 Carnival season at the Teatro San Samuele in Venice. It was the fourth of Donizetti’s operas to be performed during his lifetime and the first to achieve \"more than one production\". It had about seven stagings until 1827, when its last known performance in the 19th century took place."

      "description": "My Lady Molly is a 'comedy opera' in two acts with a libretto by George H. Jessop, with additional lyrics by Percy Greenbank and Charles H. Taylor, and music by Sidney Jones. The story centers around Lady Molly Martingale, a vivacious young woman, who disguises herself as a man to win the man she loves. The piece opened at the Theatre Royal in Brighton, England, on 11 August 1902 and then at Terry's Theatre in London on 14 March 1903, under the management of Frederick Mouillot, running for 342 performances. It starred Sybil Arundale and featured Decima Moore. It also enjoyed tours and had a brief Broadway run. My Lady Molly was the last successful English comic opera in the tradition of Alfred Cellier's Dorothy and Arthur Sullivan's Haddon Hall, as distinguished from the style of the lighter Edwardian musical comedies of the period. A review in The Daily Mail stated:"

It tells of the return from exile in England of the Breton prince Jean de Montfort (known as \"The Swan of Montfort\") and his defeat of the French army under Bertrand du Guesclin in 1379. It has been recorded by, amongst others, Alan Stivell and Gilles Servat. The Scottish folk song \"The Twa Corbies\", a variation of the English song \"The Three Ravens\", was set to the tune of \"An Alarc'h\" by R.M. Blythman."
